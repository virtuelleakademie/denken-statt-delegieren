## Core Principle

The goal is not to ban AI tools, but to create environments where students **choose** cognitive effort over shortcuts because they understand its value for their learning.

## Key Strategies

### 1. Restructure Assessment to Value Process

::: {.callout-tip}
## The "Thinking Portfolio" Approach

Instead of grading only final answers, create portfolios that showcase the learning journey:

- **25%** - Initial attempts (even if wrong)
- **25%** - Error analysis and corrections
- **25%** - Progressive improvement
- **25%** - Final understanding demonstration

This makes AI shortcuts counterproductiveâ€”students need authentic struggles to document.
:::

### 2. Design AI-Resistant Tasks

Transform generic assignments into personal, contextual challenges:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Traditional
"Write an essay about climate change"

## AI-Resistant
"Connect climate change to three specific observations from your neighborhood this week"

## Why It Works
Personal observations can't be generated by AI, requiring genuine engagement with the topic.
:::

### 3. Implement Progressive Problem Sets

Create assignments where each problem builds on insights from previous attempts:

```
Problem 1: Solve 2x + 3 = 7
Problem 2: Explain why your method from Problem 1 would fail for 2(x+3) = 7
Problem 3: Create a problem that looks similar but requires a different approach
```

AI can't help when each step requires reflection on YOUR previous work.

### 4. The Struggle Window Policy

Structure class time to normalize and require cognitive effort:

::: {.callout-note}
## Timed Resource Access

**Minutes 0-10**: Just you and the problem  
**Minutes 10-20**: Peer discussion allowed  
**Minutes 20-30**: Textbook/notes available  
**Minutes 30+**: Teacher consultation  
**Never during class**: AI consultation
:::

### 5. Create a Culture of Productive Failure

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Celebrate Errors
- **Error Museum**: Display "magnificent mistakes"
- **Struggle Journals**: Daily reflection on confusion
- **Red Pen Revolution**: Red marks = growth opportunities
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Make Struggle Visible
- Track time in productive struggle
- Share teacher's own mistakes
- Reward error analysis quality
:::
:::

### 6. The Learning Gym Model

Frame learning as mental fitness training:

::: {.callout-note}
## Learning = Exercise for Your Brain

Just like physical fitness, cognitive fitness requires:

- **Workout Plans**: Posted topic-specific practice sequences
- **Reps**: Practice problems (no shortcuts to mental fitness!)
- **Spotters**: Peer helpers who support but don't do the lifting
- **Form Check**: Teacher feedback on technique
- **Progress Tracking**: Visible improvement charts

Post this analogy prominently: "You wouldn't expect muscles from watching someone else exercise. Why expect learning from watching AI think?"
:::

### 7. The Cognitive Load Meter

Teach students to monitor and communicate their cognitive state:

::: {.callout-tip}
## Student Self-Assessment Tool

Have students regularly indicate their cognitive load:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: "Too easyâ€”I'm not learning" 
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: "Just rightâ€”productive struggle"
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: "Overloadedâ€”need scaffolding"

**Key insight**: ðŸŸ¡ is the target zone! Green means you need harder problems. Red means you need support, not answers.

Use hand signals, color cards, or digital polls for quick class-wide checks.
:::

## Subject-Specific Strategies

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Mathematics
- Require multiple solution methods
- "Show three wrong approaches before the right one"
- Create problems for peers to solve
- Analyze error patterns in data sets

## Writing
- Mandatory "awful first drafts"
- Document revision thinking process
- Voice recordings of thought evolution
- Peer editing before any tech tools

## Science
- Failed experiment reflections worth more points
- Hypothesis revision journals
- "What went wrong?" lab reports
- Predict-observe-explain cycles

## Programming
- Debug broken code (no running allowed)
- Explain code line-by-line to a partner
- Write code that accomplishes task in 3 different ways
- Progressive complexity building on previous solutions
:::

## Assessment Innovations

### Multi-Stage Assessments

Break evaluations into phases that require authentic engagement:

1. **Stage 1** (33%): Attempt without resources
2. **Stage 2** (33%): Revise based on peer discussion  
3. **Stage 3** (34%): Final solution with teaching demonstration

Students need their own errors from Stage 1 to succeed in Stage 2.

### The "Explain to a Novice" Test

Final assessments require teaching the concept to someone else:
- Can't fake understanding when teaching
- Rewards deep comprehension
- Makes AI-generated answers insufficient

## Quick Implementation Ideas

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## For Tomorrow's Class

1. **Start with a Struggle Window**: First 10 minutes, no resources
2. **Add an Error Reflection**: "What confused you? Why was it valuable?"
3. **Create Progressive Problems**: Each builds on the previous
4. **Celebrate a Mistake**: Share your own or highlight a student's
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't punish AI useâ€”make it unnecessary
- Don't create busyworkâ€”ensure struggle has purpose
- Don't grade harshlyâ€”reward growth over perfection
- Don't work aloneâ€”collaborate with colleagues
:::

## Measuring Success

Track these indicators to know your environment promotes deep learning:

- âœ… Increased time before help-seeking
- âœ… More detailed error analyses
- âœ… Students choosing harder problems
- âœ… Better peer teaching quality
- âœ… Decreased AI usage by choice
- âœ… Improved transfer to new contexts

## The Red Line Rule

::: {.callout-important}
## Preventing AI Dependency

**If a student can't solve a problem without AI after using AI 5 times, they're not learningâ€”they're dependent.**

When this happens:
1. Step back to worked examples
2. Rebuild from fundamentals
3. Practice without AI until mastery
4. Only then reintroduce AI as a tool

This clear boundary helps students recognize when tool use becomes crutch use.
:::

## Your Three Commitments

### 1. Protect the Weak Methods Phase
- Recognize when students use means-end analysis (it's normal!)
- Don't provide expert shortcuts to novices
- Document weak methods as evidence of learning
- Say: "I see you're working backwardâ€”that's exactly right!"

### 2. Design for Knowledge Compilation
- Provide MANY similar problems (repetition drives compilation)
- Progress from worked examples to independence:
  - Week 1: Step-by-step worked examples
  - Week 2: Partially completed examples
  - Week 3: Hints only
  - Week 4: Independent practice

### 3. Calibrate Cognitive Load by Expertise
- Assess element interactivity FOR YOUR STUDENTS
- High interactivity + novice = worked examples first
- Low interactivity OR growing expertise = productive struggle
- Never let AI eliminate load entirely

## Your Next Steps

1. **Choose one strategy** to implement this week
2. **Apply the Red Line Rule** to monitor AI dependency
3. **Document the results** (both successes and challenges)
4. **Share with colleagues** to build momentum
5. **Iterate based on feedback** from students

## Key Messages to Reinforce

::: {.callout-important}
## Daily Reminders for Students

- "Your confusion is data about your learning edge"
- "Errors are information, not failures"  
- "If it feels easy, you're not learning"
- "Your brain grows when you struggle"
- "AI gives answers but robs understanding"
:::

## The Ultimate Goal

> Create an environment where students say: "I could use AI, but then I wouldn't learn anything. Let me struggle with this firstâ€”that's where the real learning happens."

When students understand and value their own cognitive development, they become partners in protecting their learning journey rather than adversaries trying to game the system.
