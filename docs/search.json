    "text": "The Weak-to-Strong Methods Progression\nAccording to John Anderson’s ACT-R theory (Anderson 1982, 2007), expertise develops through a predictable progression:\n\n1. Weak Methods (Novice Stage)\nWeak methods are domain-general problem-solving strategies that novices use when they lack specific knowledge:\n\nMeans-End Analysis: What's the difference between where I am and where I need to be?\nWorking Backward: Start from the goal and work toward current state\nAnalogy: This reminds me of... (often based on surface features)\nTrial and Error: Let me try different things until something works\nHill Climbing: Always move toward what seems better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Novice solving \\(3x + 5 = 20\\)\n\n\n\nUsing weak methods:\n\nGoal is to find \\(x\\)\nCurrent state: \\(3x + 5 = 20\\)\nHow to reduce difference?\nMaybe subtract \\(5\\)?\nWhy? Um… to get \\(x\\) alone?\nOK, so \\(3x = 15\\)\nNow what reduces the difference?\nDivide by \\(3\\)?\n\\(x = 5\\)\n\nNote the deliberative, step-by-step reasoning!\n\n\n\n\n2. Proceduralization (Intermediate Stage)\n\nRepeated patterns become procedures\nStill conscious but more fluid\nReduced cognitive load\nFaster with fewer errors\nExample: Using multiplication tables from memory\n\nDuring this stage, knowledge begins forming into production rules. These are IF-THEN condition-action pairs:\n\nIF I see “3 × 4” THEN answer “12”\nIF equation has form \\(ax + b = c\\) THEN subtract b from both sides\nIF code won’t compile THEN check for syntax errors first\n\n\n\n3. Compilation (Expert Stage)\n\nKnowledge becomes automatic through many practice episodes\nPattern recognition dominates\nMinimal cognitive load\nFast and accurate\nCannot explain steps anymore!\n\nProduction strength determines which rules fire: frequently successful rules become stronger and fire faster. This is why practice improves both speed AND accuracy—stronger productions outcompete weaker alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Expert solving \\(3x + 5 = 20\\)\n\n\n\nExpert sees equation and can instantly recognize → \\(x = 5\\)\nWhen asked to explain:\n\n“I just… know?”\n“You subtract 5 and divide by 3”\n“How did I know that? I’m not sure…”\n\nThe knowledge has compiled into automatic procedures.",

    "text": "Understanding Cognitive Load Theory\n\nThe Evolutionary Foundation of Learning\nCognitive Load Theory (CLT) (Sweller 2023) is specifically concerned with how humans acquire biologically secondary knowledge—the academic content that schools exist to teach. Understanding this distinction is crucial for grasping why AI can disrupt learning so profoundly.\n\nBiologically Primary vs. Secondary Knowledge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge Type\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nBiologically Primary (we evolved to learn)\n• Recognizing faces and voices• Understanding basic social interactions• Learning spoken language• Basic spatial navigation• Recognizing danger and safety\n\n\nBiologically Secondary (we didn’t evolve to learn)\n• Reading and writing• Mathematics and algebra• Programming and data analysis• Scientific reasoning• Historical analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Distinction Matters\n\n\n\n\nPrimary knowledge can be learned through natural discovery and play\nSecondary knowledge requires explicit instruction and guided practice\nSchools exist precisely because secondary knowledge doesn’t develop naturally\nAI disruption is particularly damaging for secondary knowledge acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cognitive Architecture of Learning\nCLT is based on how human cognition actually processes information, using an architecture that mirrors evolution by natural selection (Sweller 2023):\n\nTwo Pathways for Novel Information\nHumans can acquire new biologically secondary information through two routes:\n\nDiscovery During Problem Solving: Working through challenges independently\nLearning From Others: Receiving information through instruction\n\nCrucially: Both these acquisition skills are themselves biologically primary—we evolved to be excellent at discovering things and learning from others. This is why humans dominate the mammalian world.\n\n\nThe Processing Bottleneck\nOnce information is acquired through either pathway, it must be processed through:\nWorking Memory:\n\nSeverely limited capacity (Miller’s 7±2, more recently Cowan’s 4±1 chunks)\nSeverely limited duration (15-30 seconds without rehearsal)\nThe bottleneck where all conscious learning occurs\n\nLong-Term Memory:\n\nNo known limits of capacity or duration\nWhere expertise lives through domain-specific information storage\nThe goal of all instruction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement Interactivity in Action\n\n\n\nConsider solving: \\((x + 3)(x - 2) = 0\\)\nFor a novice, each element must be held in working memory: - What \\(x\\) represents - The meaning of parentheses - Addition and subtraction operations - Implied multiplication - The significance of “equals zero” - How to find solutions\nTotal: 7+ interacting elements = Working memory overload\nFor an expert, this is one chunk retrieved from long-term memory: - “Factored form, so \\(x = -3\\) or \\(x = 2\\)”\nTotal: 1 chunk = Minimal working memory load\nWith Offloading to AI: - Input → Answer\nTotal: 0 working memory processing = No learning, no long-term memory storage\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Expertise Actually Develops\nAs De Groot first demonstrated in 1965 (Groot and Groot 1978; Sweller 2024), expertise is domain-specific and results from enormous amounts of domain-specific information stored in long-term memory. This isn’t just “knowing more facts”—it’s having organized knowledge structures (schemas) that allow experts to:\n\nChunk multiple elements into single units\nRecognize patterns automatically\nAccess procedures without conscious effort\nFree up working memory for higher-level thinking",

    "text": "Pedagogical Implications\n\nThe Expert-Novice Teaching Trap\nThe most dangerous mistake in education is assuming that novices should learn the way experts work. This leads to what Kirschner (Kirschner, Hendrick, and Heal 2022) calls confusing “the epistemology of the expert with the pedagogy for the learner.”\nWhat Experts Do (Producing Knowledge):\n\nWork forward from automated principles\nRecognize deep patterns instantly\nApply strong, domain-specific methods\nCreate and discover new knowledge\nProcess multiple elements simultaneously\n\nWhat Novices Need (Learning Knowledge):\n\nWork backward using means-end analysis\nBuild basic pattern recognition through practice\nStart with weak, general methods\nReconstruct and understand existing knowledge\nProcess elements sequentially to avoid overload\n\n\n\nWhy Expert Methods Actively Harm Novices\nGiving novices expert-level tools isn’t just ineffective—it’s actively harmful to learning:\n\n1. Cognitive Load Mismatch\n\nExperts can handle multiple interacting elements because they’ve chunked them into patterns\nNovices become overwhelmed when given the same complexity\nResult: Cognitive overload prevents any learning from occurring\n\n\n\n2. Production Rule Interference\n\nExperts have strong, successful production rules that fire automatically\nNovices need to build these rules through repeated weak-method practice\nAI shortcuts prevent the repetition needed for rule strengthening\nResult: Weak rules never develop, leaving permanent dependency\n\n\n\n3. Schema Construction Bypass\n\nExperts have rich schemas (organized knowledge structures) built through experience\nNovices must construct these schemas element by element\nAI answers provide the outcome without the construction process\nResult: No schemas form, preventing transfer to new situations\n\n\n\n4. Metacognitive Damage\n\nExperts know when and why to apply different strategies\nNovices develop this awareness through monitoring their own thinking\nAI dependency eliminates the need for self-monitoring\nResult: Students become unable to evaluate their own understanding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dependency Cascade\n\n\n\nWhen novices use expert-level tools prematurely:\n\nInitial success creates false confidence\nWeak methods atrophy from disuse\nProblem-solving skills deteriorate without practice\nDependency deepens as internal capabilities weaken\nTransfer fails when AI isn’t available\nLearned helplessness develops when facing novel challenges\n\nThis isn’t just “not learning”—it’s unlearning existing capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching That Matches How Brains Learn\n\nPrinciple 1: Respect the Developmental Sequence\n\nWeak methods must come first—they’re not a bug, they’re a feature\nProceduralization requires extensive practice with deliberative processes\nCompilation happens automatically after sufficient repetition\n\n\n\nPrinciple 2: Calibrate Cognitive Load\n\nNovices need simplified, sequential presentation\nExperts can handle complex, parallel processing\nThe same material must be presented differently based on expertise level\n\n\n\nPrinciple 3: Protect the Struggle Window\n\nAllow sufficient time for independent struggle before AI consultation\nDocument thinking process before seeking external help\nMultiple attempts required before accessing solutions\n\n\n\nPrinciple 4: Scaffold, Don’t Substitute\n\nUse AI to reduce irrelevant cognitive load, not eliminate all effort\nProvide worked examples that show the process, not just answers\nGradually fade support as competence develops (scaffolding)\n\n\n\n\nHow Prediction Errors Drive Learning\n\nHow Prediction Errors Drive Learning\nStep 1: Prediction Formation\nWhen you encounter a problem, your brain automatically predicts what should happen based on your current (prior) knowledge:\n\n“If I subtract 5 from both sides, I should get closer to solving for \\(x\\)”\n“If I apply this formula, I should get the right answer”\n“This code structure should compile without errors”\n\nStep 2: Reality Check\nYou attempt the solution and compare the actual outcome to your prediction:\n\nPositive prediction error: “That worked better than expected!”\nNegative prediction error: “That didn’t work as I thought it would”\nZero prediction error: “That went exactly as predicted”\n\nStep 3: Neural Update\nYour brain uses these errors to update its knowledge:\n\nDopamine release marks prediction errors as important learning moments\nEligibility traces tag the neural pathways involved for strengthening\nSynaptic weights adjust based on the magnitude and direction of the error\nMemory consolidation during sleep makes these changes permanent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Learning Algebra Through Prediction Errors\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempt 1: Student thinks “I need to eliminate the 5, so I’ll add 5 to both sides”\n\nPrediction: This should help solve for x\nReality: Gets \\(3x + 10 = 25\\) (moving away from solution)\nPrediction Error: Negative! This approach made things worse\nLearning: Brain tags “adding same number” as unsuccessful strategy\n\nAttempt 2: Student tries “I’ll subtract 5 from both sides”\n\nPrediction: This might work better\nReality: Gets \\(3x = 15\\) (much cleaner!)\nPrediction Error: Positive! This approach worked well\nLearning: Brain strengthens “subtract to isolate” pathway\n\nAfter many cycles: The “subtract to isolate” rule becomes automatic\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Offloading Cognitive Processing to AI Eliminates the Learning Signal\nAI provides perfect answers instantly:\n\nNo prediction phase (student doesn’t generate expectations)\nNo attempt phase (student doesn’t try solutions)\nNo error phase (no comparison between expected and actual)\nResult: Zero prediction errors = zero learning signal\n\nThe brain literally has nothing to learn from because the prediction-error cycle never occurs.\nThis explains why students can watch hundreds of worked examples or get thousands of correct AI answers and still not learn. Learning requires errors, not perfection.\n\n\n\nThe Desirable Difficulties Principle\nLearning requires what researchers call “desirable difficulties” (Bjork and Bjork 2011)—challenges that feel hard but promote long-term retention:\n\nRetrieval Practice: Pulling information from memory strengthens it\nSpaced Repetition: Forgetting and relearning creates durable knowledge\nInterleaving: Mixing problem types improves discrimination\nGeneration: Creating answers (even wrong ones) beats passive consumption\n\n\n\nThe Compilation Process\nReal expertise emerges through thousands of practice cycles:\nEncounter problem → Make prediction → Attempt solution → Compare to prediction → Get feedback → Neural adjustment\n                                                    ↓\n                                            Neural pathway strengthens\n                                                    ↓\n                                            Pattern becomes automatic\nEach cycle:\n\nStrengthens neural connections through prediction errors\nReduces processing time through repetition\nFrees working memory for higher-level thinking\nEnables creative problem-solving through strong foundations\n\nHow expertise actually works: When you encounter a problem, multiple production rules compete. The rule with highest “utility” (based on past success through prediction errors) fires. Each successful use strengthens that rule, making it more likely to win future competitions. This is why experts seem to “just know”—their strongest productions fire automatically.\n\n\nWhat We Lose When We Skip the Struggle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Lose\n\n\n\n\nNo Memory Formation: The brain doesn’t encode what it doesn’t process\nNo Pattern Development: Can’t recognize what we haven’t practiced\nNo Transfer Ability: Can’t apply unlearned principles to new contexts\nNo Metacognition: Don’t develop awareness of our own thinking\nNo Prediction Error Learning: The fundamental mechanism of learning is bypassed\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Expertise Illusion\nOffloading cognitive processing to AI creates a dangerous illusion:\n\nSurface Fluency: Perfect answers without understanding\nFalse Confidence: Believing we “get it” without practice\nFragile Knowledge: Collapses without AI support\nLimited Transfer: Can’t adapt to novel situations\n\n\n\nResearch Evidence: The Cost of Cognitive Offloading\nRecent studies show alarming impacts of AI use on learning:\n\n68% reduction in critical thinking among knowledge workers with high AI confidence (Lee et al. 2025)\nSurface learning only for programming students using ChatGPT (Yang, Hsu, and Wu 2025)\nDecreased problem-solving ability in math students using AI tools (Bastani et al. 2024)\n“The fluency illusion”: Mistaking AI’s competence for your own",

With a background as a physicist and data scientist, he’s particularly skilled at explaining why your prompts aren’t quite working as expected.\n\nIn this workshop, they will explore the delicate balance between collaborating with AI and preserving the cognitive work that makes learning stick—because sometimes the struggle really is the point."

    "text": "This presentation reveals why offloading cognitive processing to AI can undermine the development of genuine expertise. Through ACT-R (Anderson 2013, 2007) theory, it explains how learning transforms declarative knowledge into procedural skills via productive struggle. The process involves grappling with confusion, making mistakes, and adjusting strategies—steps that are easily bypassed when using AI.\nThe key takeaway: Struggling, confusion and effort aren’t obstacles to learning—they’re the very mechanisms that build lasting expertise.",

Lower-Stakes Assessment (Lang 2013)\nReplace high-stakes single assessments with frequent, lower-stakes evaluations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch-Based Approach\n\n\n\nInstead of a final exam worth 50%, use:\n\nFive tests worth 10% each\nWeekly reflection journals\nMultiple opportunities to demonstrate learning\n\nThis reduces anxiety-driven shortcuts while improving retention through the testing effect (Roediger and Karpicke 2006).\n\n\n\n\n2. Intrinsic Motivation Design (Lang 2013)\nBuild courses around meaningful problems rather than content coverage:\nCoverage-Based: “Read Chapter 7 on climate change”\nProblem-Based: “Analyze how climate patterns in your hometown have changed using local weather data”\nProblems rooted in students’ environments may tap intrinsic motivation and therefore be less prone to AI generation.\n\n\n3. Spaced Repetition (Cepeda et al. 2006)\nDistribute practice across time rather than massing it:\nWeek 1: Introduce concept A\nWeek 3: Review concept A while learning B  \nWeek 6: Apply concepts A & B to new context\nWeek 10: Connect A & B to concept C\nResearch shows spaced practice improves long-term retention by 200-300%.\n\n\n4. Retrieval Practice (Roediger and Karpicke 2006)\nUse testing as a learning tool, not just assessment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation Strategy\n\n\n\nLow-stakes retrieval opportunities:\n\nStart each class with a 2-minute quiz on previous material\nWeekly “brain dumps” where students write everything they remember\nPeer teaching exercises\nPractice problems without looking at notes first\n\nResearch shows retrieval practice produces better transfer than repeated studying.\n\n\n\n\n5. Interleaved Practice (Rohrer 2012)\nMix different types of problems within assignments:\nInstead of 20 algebra problems, then 20 geometry problems, mix them:\n\nProblems 1, 4, 7: Algebra\nProblems 2, 5, 8: Geometry\n\nProblems 3, 6, 9: Word problems requiring both\n\nInterleaving improves discrimination between similar concepts and long-term retention.\n\n\n6. Cognitive Load Management (Sweller 2023)\nDesign instruction to optimize working memory capacity while preserving productive struggle:\nFor Novices:\n\nProvide worked examples before independent practice\nReduce extraneous cognitive load while maintaining intrinsic challenge\n\nFor Advanced Learners:\n\nIncrease element interactivity gradually\nEncourage productive struggle through appropriately difficult tasks\nFocus on germane (learning-productive) cognitive load",

Choose any three questions from the list below, but ensure you follow the sequence of research modes in order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does text-only learning shape comprehension, and what factors govern its effectiveness?\nHow do brief summaries influence comprehension, and which elements drive their success?\nHow does crafting a personal explanation boost critical thinking, and what are its limits?\nWhat makes partner feedback such an effective learning tool, and how can you use it best?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask per Research Mode\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each research mode, you’ll work on a different question. Focus on the following:\n\nHow does the learner acquire knowledge using this approach?\nWhen and how is that approach beneficial?\nWhat are the pros and cons of this approach?\n\nAdd your answer as a sticky note in this Miro Board, within the frame for your question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Modes\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 3 sessions (5 minutes each) to approach the question differently:\n\nWithout Chatbot: Research or discuss using classical sources or prior knowledge.\nWith Chatbot Only: Use a single well-crafted prompt to get the best possible answer.\nWith Chatbot Collaboration: Interact with the chatbot iteratively—ask follow-up questions, refine the answer collaboratively.\n\nA short example will be shown for each mode before starting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection (10 minutes)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter engaging in fast-paced research and experiencing first hand how chatbots are usually applied in this context, we now want to reflect on the experience using the following steps:\n\nThink (1 minute): Take a moment to reflect individually on questions below.\n\nPair (3 minutes): Discuss your reflections with a partner and compare your insights.\n\nShare (6 minutes): Share key takeaways with the group.\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nHow did the different sessions differ regarding how you learned and how you experienced that learning?\nWhat pros and cons did you experience using chatbots for learning?\nWhat’s your advice on when and how to use Chatbots for learning something new? Does it apply to novices and experts alike?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway\nWe explored how AI processes information and its impact on human learning. We generally find that using chatbots can reduce cognitive engagement. According to a recent study on the cognitive cost of using an LLM for essay writing (Kosmyna et al. 2025), this actually shows in lower brain activity, resulting in a lack of comprehension as well as in worse memorization of their own original text written on the topic.\nThe key take away is: When learning new concepts, use AI assistants strategically—to handle irrelevant administrative tasks and scaffold your thinking, not to bypass the productive struggle that builds genuine understanding. The cognitive effort you experience when grappling with new ideas isn’t a bug to be fixed; it’s the very mechanism through which expertise develops.",

Respect the Developmental Sequence\n\n\n\nWeak methods must come first—they’re not a bug, they’re a feature\nProceduralization requires extensive practice with deliberative processes\nCompilation happens automatically after sufficient repetition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Calibrate Cognitive Load\n\n\n\nNovices need simplified, sequential presentation\nExperts can handle complex, parallel processing\nThe same material must be presented differently based on expertise level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Protect the Struggle Window\n\n\n\nAllow sufficient time for independent struggle before AI consultation\nDocument thinking process before seeking external help\nMultiple attempts required before accessing solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Scaffold, Don’t Substitute\n\n\n\nUse AI to reduce irrelevant cognitive load, not eliminate all effort\nProvide worked examples that show the process, not just answers\nGradually fade support as competence develops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Key Insight:\n\n\nAI is an expert-level tool. Using it before building foundational skills through weak methods isn’t just ineffective—it actively prevents the very processes that create expertise.\nDesign learning experiences that match how brains actually develop competence."
