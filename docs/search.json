For each mode, you should answer a different question, and while you can choose any question for each mode, it’s important to follow the sequence of the modes in order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does text-only learning shape comprehension, and what factors govern its effectiveness?\nHow do brief summaries influence comprehension, and which elements drive their success?\nHow does crafting a personal explanation boost critical thinking, and what are its limits?\nHow does partner feedback on your understanding boost learning? When and how is it most effective?\n\n\n\nTask per Session\nFor a given question, focus on the following: - How does the learner acquire knowledge using this approach? - When and how is that approach beneficial? - What are the pros and cons of this approach?\nAdd your answer as a sticky note in this Miro Board (Password: ThinkAIWS), within the frame for your question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Modes\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 3 sessions (5 minutes each) to approach the question differently:\n\nWithout Chatbot: Research or discuss using classical sources or prior knowledge.\nWith Chatbot Only: Use a single well-crafted prompt to get the best possible answer.\nWith Chatbot Collaboration: Interact with the chatbot iteratively—ask follow-up questions, refine the answer collaboratively.\n\nA short example will be shown for each mode before starting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection (10 minutes)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter engaging in fast-paced research and experiencing first hand how chatbots are usually applied in this context, we now want to reflect on the experience using the following steps: 1. Think (1 minute): Take a moment to reflect individually on questions below.\n2. Pair (3 minutes): Discuss your reflections with a partner and compare your insights.\n3. Share (6 minutes): Share key takeaways with the group.\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nHow did the different sessions differ regarding how you learned and how you experienced that learning?\nWhat Pros and Cons did you experience using chatbots for learning?\nWhat’s your advice on when and how to use Chatbots for learning something new? Does it apply to novices and experts alike?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway\nWe explored how AI processes information and its impact on human learning. We generally find that using chatbots can reduce cognitive engagement. According to a new study by MIT, this actually shows in lower brain activity, resulting in a lack of comprehension as well as in worse memorization of their own original text written on the topic. The key take away is: students and researches should use chatbots for learning new information only so to reduce mental load from irrelevant sidetasks and to foster cognitive engagement rather than to replace it, by letting it help develop and evaluate independent thoughts rather than reducing everything to executive summaries.",

When and how is it most effective?\n\n\n\nTask per Session\nFor a given question, focus on the following: - How does the learner acquire knowledge using this approach? - When and how is that approach beneficial? - What are the pros and cons of this approach?\nAdd your answer as a sticky note in this Miro Board (Password: ThinkAIWS), within the frame for your question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Modes\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 3 sessions (5 minutes each) to approach the question differently:\n\nWithout Chatbot: Research or discuss using classical sources or prior knowledge.\nWith Chatbot Only: Use a single well-crafted prompt to get the best possible answer.\nWith Chatbot Collaboration: Interact with the chatbot iteratively—ask follow-up questions, refine the answer collaboratively.\n\nA short example will be shown for each mode before starting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection (10 minutes)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter engaging in fast-paced research and experiencing first hand how chatbots are usually applied in this context, we now want to reflect on the experience using the following steps: 1. Think (1 minute): Take a moment to reflect individually on questions below.\n2. Pair (3 minutes): Discuss your reflections with a partner and compare your insights.\n3. Share (6 minutes): Share key takeaways with the group.\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nHow did the different sessions differ regarding how you learned and how you experienced that learning?\nWhat Pros and Cons did you experience using chatbots for learning?\nWhat’s your advice on when and how to use Chatbots for learning something new? Does it apply to novices and experts alike?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway\nWe explored how AI processes information and its impact on human learning. We generally find that using chatbots can reduce cognitive engagement. According to a new study by MIT, this actually shows in lower brain activity, resulting in a lack of comprehension as well as in worse memorization of their own original text written on the topic. The key take away is: students and researches should use chatbots for learning new information only so to reduce mental load from irrelevant sidetasks and to foster cognitive engagement rather than to replace it, by letting it help develop and evaluate independent thoughts rather than reducing everything to executive summaries."

    "section": "The Weak-to-Strong Methods Progression",
    "text": "The Weak-to-Strong Methods Progression\nAccording to John Anderson’s ACT-R theory (Anderson 1982, 2007), expertise develops through a predictable progression:\n\n1. Weak Methods (Novice Stage)\nWeak methods are domain-general problem-solving strategies that novices use when they lack specific knowledge:\n\nMeans-End Analysis: “What’s the difference between where I am and where I need to be?”\nWorking Backward: “Start from the goal and work toward current state”\nAnalogy: “This reminds me of…” (often based on surface features)\nTrial and Error: “Let me try different things until something works”\nHill Climbing: “Always move toward what seems better”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Novice Solving 3x + 5 = 20\n\n\n\nUsing weak methods: - “Goal is to find x” - “Current state: 3x + 5 = 20” - “How to reduce difference?” - “Maybe subtract 5?” - “Why? Um… to get x alone?” - “OK, so 3x = 15” - “Now what reduces the difference?” - “Divide by 3?” - “x = 5”\nNote the conscious, step-by-step reasoning!\n\n\n\n\n2. Proceduralization (Intermediate Stage)\n\nRepeated patterns become procedures\nStill conscious but more fluid\nReduced cognitive load\nFaster with fewer errors\nExample: Using multiplication tables from memory\n\nDuring this stage, knowledge begins forming into production rules—IF-THEN condition-action pairs: - IF I see “3 × 4” THEN answer “12” - IF equation has form “ax + b = c” THEN subtract b from both sides - IF code won’t compile THEN check for syntax errors first\n\n\n3. Compilation (Expert Stage)\n\nKnowledge becomes automatic through thousands of practice episodes\nPattern recognition dominates\nMinimal cognitive load\nFast and accurate\nCannot explain steps anymore!\n\nProduction strength determines which rules fire: frequently successful rules become stronger and fire faster. This is why practice improves both speed AND accuracy—stronger productions outcompete weaker alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Expert Solving 3x + 5 = 20\n\n\n\nExpert sees equation → Instant recognition → “x = 5”\nWhen asked to explain: - “I just… know?” - “You subtract 5 and divide by 3” - “How did I know that? I’m not sure…”\nThe knowledge has compiled into automatic procedures!\n\n\n\n\nEvidence: Anderson’s LISP Study\nIn a landmark study, 40 participants learning LISP programming ALL showed the same struggle pattern: - Everyone had difficulty specifying function parameters - This wasn’t random—it revealed a necessary developmental stage - Through practice, the difficulty disappeared - Not through sudden understanding, but through compilation\nKey insight: The struggle patterns are predictable and necessary!"

    "text": "Why Cognitive Effort Matters\n\nThe Desirable Difficulties Principle\nLearning requires what researchers call “desirable difficulties”—challenges that feel hard but promote long-term retention:\n\nRetrieval Practice: Pulling information from memory strengthens it\nSpaced Repetition: Forgetting and relearning creates durable knowledge\nInterleaving: Mixing problem types improves discrimination\nGeneration: Creating answers (even wrong ones) beats passive consumption\n\n\n\nThe Compilation Process\nReal expertise emerges through thousands of practice cycles:\nEncounter problem → Conscious solving → Feedback → Adjustment\n                           ↓\n                    Neural pathway strengthens\n                           ↓\n                    Pattern becomes automatic\nEach cycle: - Strengthens neural connections - Reduces processing time - Frees working memory for higher-level thinking - Enables creative problem-solving\nHow expertise actually works: When you encounter a problem, multiple production rules compete. The rule with highest “utility” (based on past success) fires. Each successful use strengthens that rule, making it more likely to win future competitions. This is why experts seem to “just know”—their strongest productions fire automatically."

    "text": "Key Strategies\n\n1. Restructure Assessment to Value Process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Thinking Portfolio” Approach\n\n\n\nInstead of grading only final answers, create portfolios that showcase the learning journey:\n\n25% - Initial attempts (even if wrong)\n25% - Error analysis and corrections\n25% - Progressive improvement\n25% - Final understanding demonstration\n\nThis makes AI shortcuts counterproductive—students need authentic struggles to document.\n\n\n\n\n2. Design AI-Resistant Tasks\nTransform generic assignments into personal, contextual challenges:\n\nTraditionalAI-ResistantWhy It Works\n\n\n“Write an essay about climate change”\n\n\n“Connect climate change to three specific observations from your neighborhood this week”\n\n\nPersonal observations can’t be generated by AI, requiring genuine engagement with the topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Implement Progressive Problem Sets\nCreate assignments where each problem builds on insights from previous attempts:\nProblem 1: Solve 2x + 3 = 7\nProblem 2: Explain why your method from Problem 1 would fail for 2(x+3) = 7\nProblem 3: Create a problem that looks similar but requires a different approach\nAI can’t help when each step requires reflection on YOUR previous work.\n\n\n4. The Struggle Window Policy\nStructure class time to normalize and require cognitive effort:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimed Resource Access\n\n\n\nMinutes 0-10: Just you and the problem\nMinutes 10-20: Peer discussion allowed\nMinutes 20-30: Textbook/notes available\nMinutes 30+: Teacher consultation\nNever during class: AI consultation\n\n\n\n\n5. Create a Culture of Productive Failure\n\n\n\n\nCelebrate Errors\n\nError Museum: Display “magnificent mistakes”\nStruggle Journals: Daily reflection on confusion\nRed Pen Revolution: Red marks = growth opportunities\n\n\n\n\nMake Struggle Visible\n\nTrack time in productive struggle\nShare teacher’s own mistakes\nReward error analysis quality\n\n\n\n\n\n6. The Learning Gym Model\nFrame learning as mental fitness training:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning = Exercise for Your Brain\n\n\n\nJust like physical fitness, cognitive fitness requires:\n\nWorkout Plans: Posted topic-specific practice sequences\nReps: Practice problems (no shortcuts to mental fitness!)\nSpotters: Peer helpers who support but don’t do the lifting\nForm Check: Teacher feedback on technique\nProgress Tracking: Visible improvement charts\n\nPost this analogy prominently: “You wouldn’t expect muscles from watching someone else exercise. Why expect learning from watching AI think?”\n\n\n\n\n7. The Cognitive Load Meter\nTeach students to monitor and communicate their cognitive state:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Self-Assessment Tool\n\n\n\nHave students regularly indicate their cognitive load:\n\n🟢 Green: “Too easy—I’m not learning”\n🟡 Yellow: “Just right—productive struggle”\n🔴 Red: “Overloaded—need scaffolding”\n\nKey insight: 🟡 is the target zone! Green means you need harder problems. Red means you need support, not answers.\nUse hand signals, color cards, or digital polls for quick class-wide checks."

    "text": "Your Three Commitments\n\n1. Protect the Weak Methods Phase\n\nRecognize when students use means-end analysis (it’s normal!)\nDon’t provide expert shortcuts to novices\nDocument weak methods as evidence of learning\nSay: “I see you’re working backward—that’s exactly right!”\n\n\n\n2. Design for Knowledge Compilation\n\nProvide MANY similar problems (repetition drives compilation)\nProgress from worked examples to independence:\n\nWeek 1: Step-by-step worked examples\nWeek 2: Partially completed examples\nWeek 3: Hints only\nWeek 4: Independent practice\n\n\n\n\n3. Calibrate Cognitive Load by Expertise\n\nAssess element interactivity FOR YOUR STUDENTS\nHigh interactivity + novice = worked examples first\nLow interactivity OR growing expertise = productive struggle\nNever let AI eliminate load entirely"
