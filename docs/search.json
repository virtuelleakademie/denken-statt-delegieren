For each mode, you should answer a different question, and while you can choose any question for each mode, it’s important to follow the sequence of the modes in order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does text-only learning shape comprehension, and what factors govern its effectiveness?\nHow do brief summaries influence comprehension, and which elements drive their success?\nHow does crafting a personal explanation boost critical thinking, and what are its limits?\nHow does partner feedback on your understanding boost learning? When and how is it most effective?\n\n\n\nTask per Session\nFor a given question, focus on the following: - How does the learner acquire knowledge using this approach? - When and how is that approach beneficial? - What are the pros and cons of this approach?\nAdd your answer as a sticky note in this Miro Board (Password: ThinkAIWS), within the frame for your question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Modes\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 3 sessions (5 minutes each) to approach the question differently:\n\nWithout Chatbot: Research or discuss using classical sources or prior knowledge.\nWith Chatbot Only: Use a single well-crafted prompt to get the best possible answer.\nWith Chatbot Collaboration: Interact with the chatbot iteratively—ask follow-up questions, refine the answer collaboratively.\n\nA short example will be shown for each mode before starting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection (10 minutes)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter engaging in fast-paced research and experiencing first hand how chatbots are usually applied in this context, we now want to reflect on the experience using the following steps: 1. Think (1 minute): Take a moment to reflect individually on questions below.\n2. Pair (3 minutes): Discuss your reflections with a partner and compare your insights.\n3. Share (6 minutes): Share key takeaways with the group.\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nHow did the different sessions differ regarding how you learned and how you experienced that learning?\nWhat Pros and Cons did you experience using chatbots for learning?\nWhat’s your advice on when and how to use Chatbots for learning something new? Does it apply to novices and experts alike?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway\nWe explored how AI processes information and its impact on human learning. We generally find that using chatbots can reduce cognitive engagement. According to a new study by MIT, this actually shows in lower brain activity, resulting in a lack of comprehension as well as in worse memorization of their own original text written on the topic. The key take away is: students and researches should use chatbots for learning new information only so to reduce mental load from irrelevant sidetasks and to foster cognitive engagement rather than to replace it, by letting it help develop and evaluate independent thoughts rather than reducing everything to executive summaries.",

When and how is it most effective?\n\n\n\nTask per Session\nFor a given question, focus on the following: - How does the learner acquire knowledge using this approach? - When and how is that approach beneficial? - What are the pros and cons of this approach?\nAdd your answer as a sticky note in this Miro Board (Password: ThinkAIWS), within the frame for your question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Modes\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 3 sessions (5 minutes each) to approach the question differently:\n\nWithout Chatbot: Research or discuss using classical sources or prior knowledge.\nWith Chatbot Only: Use a single well-crafted prompt to get the best possible answer.\nWith Chatbot Collaboration: Interact with the chatbot iteratively—ask follow-up questions, refine the answer collaboratively.\n\nA short example will be shown for each mode before starting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection (10 minutes)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter engaging in fast-paced research and experiencing first hand how chatbots are usually applied in this context, we now want to reflect on the experience using the following steps: 1. Think (1 minute): Take a moment to reflect individually on questions below.\n2. Pair (3 minutes): Discuss your reflections with a partner and compare your insights.\n3. Share (6 minutes): Share key takeaways with the group.\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nHow did the different sessions differ regarding how you learned and how you experienced that learning?\nWhat Pros and Cons did you experience using chatbots for learning?\nWhat’s your advice on when and how to use Chatbots for learning something new? Does it apply to novices and experts alike?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway\nWe explored how AI processes information and its impact on human learning. We generally find that using chatbots can reduce cognitive engagement. According to a new study by MIT, this actually shows in lower brain activity, resulting in a lack of comprehension as well as in worse memorization of their own original text written on the topic. The key take away is: students and researches should use chatbots for learning new information only so to reduce mental load from irrelevant sidetasks and to foster cognitive engagement rather than to replace it, by letting it help develop and evaluate independent thoughts rather than reducing everything to executive summaries."

    "text": "The Weak-to-Strong Methods Progression\nAccording to John Anderson’s ACT-R theory (Anderson 1982, 2007), expertise develops through a predictable progression:\n\n1. Weak Methods (Novice Stage)\nWeak methods are domain-general problem-solving strategies that novices use when they lack specific knowledge:\n\nMeans-End Analysis: “What’s the difference between where I am and where I need to be?”\nWorking Backward: “Start from the goal and work toward current state”\nAnalogy: “This reminds me of…” (often based on surface features)\nTrial and Error: “Let me try different things until something works”\nHill Climbing: “Always move toward what seems better”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Novice solving \\(3x + 5 = 20\\)\n\n\n\nUsing weak methods:\n\nGoal is to find \\(x\\)\nCurrent state: \\(3x + 5 = 20\\)\nHow to reduce difference?\nMaybe subtract \\(5\\)?\nWhy? Um… to get \\(x\\) alone?\nOK, so \\(3x = 15\\)\nNow what reduces the difference?\nDivide by \\(3\\)?\n\\(x = 5\\)\n\nNote the conscious, step-by-step reasoning!\n\n\n\n\n2. Proceduralization (Intermediate Stage)\n\nRepeated patterns become procedures\nStill conscious but more fluid\nReduced cognitive load\nFaster with fewer errors\nExample: Using multiplication tables from memory\n\nDuring this stage, knowledge begins forming into production rules. These are IF-THEN condition-action pairs:\n\nIF I see “3 × 4” THEN answer “12”\nIF equation has form “ax + b = c” THEN subtract b from both sides\nIF code won’t compile THEN check for syntax errors first\n\n\n\n3. Compilation (Expert Stage)\n\nKnowledge becomes automatic through many practice episodes\nPattern recognition dominates\nMinimal cognitive load\nFast and accurate\nCannot explain steps anymore!\n\nProduction strength determines which rules fire: frequently successful rules become stronger and fire faster. This is why practice improves both speed AND accuracy—stronger productions outcompete weaker alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Expert solving \\(3x + 5 = 20\\)\n\n\n\nExpert sees equation and can instantly recognize → \\(x = 5\\)\nWhen asked to explain:\n\n“I just… know?”\n“You subtract 5 and divide by 3”\n“How did I know that? I’m not sure…”\n\nThe knowledge has compiled into automatic procedures.\n\n\n\n\nEvidence: Anderson’s LISP Study\nIn a landmark study, 40 participants learning LISP programming ALL showed the same struggle pattern:\n\nEveryone had difficulty specifying function parameters\nThis wasn’t random—it revealed a necessary developmental stage\nThrough practice, the difficulty disappeared\nNot through sudden understanding, but through compilation\n\nKey insight: The struggle patterns are predictable and necessary!",

    "section": "Why Cognitive Effort Matters",
    "text": "Why Cognitive Effort Matters\n\nThe Prediction Error Learning System\nThe human brain learns through a sophisticated prediction error system that AI completely bypasses:\n\nHow Prediction Errors Drive Learning\nStep 1: Prediction Formation When you encounter a problem, your brain automatically predicts what should happen based on current knowledge: - “If I subtract 5 from both sides, I should get closer to solving for x” - “If I apply this formula, I should get the right answer” - “This code structure should compile without errors”\nStep 2: Reality Check You attempt the solution and compare the actual outcome to your prediction: - Positive prediction error: “That worked better than expected!” - Negative prediction error: “That didn’t work as I thought it would” - Zero prediction error: “That went exactly as predicted”\nStep 3: Neural Update Your brain uses these errors to update its knowledge: - Dopamine release marks prediction errors as important learning moments - Eligibility traces tag the neural pathways involved for strengthening - Synaptic weights adjust based on the magnitude and direction of the error - Memory consolidation during sleep makes these changes permanent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Learning Algebra Through Prediction Errors\n\n\n\nAttempt 1: Student thinks “I need to eliminate the 5, so I’ll add 5 to both sides” - Prediction: This should help solve for x - Reality: Gets \\(3x + 10 = 25\\) (moving away from solution) - Prediction Error: Negative! This approach made things worse - Learning: Brain tags “adding same number” as unsuccessful strategy\nAttempt 2: Student tries “I’ll subtract 5 from both sides” - Prediction: This might work better - Reality: Gets \\(3x = 15\\) (much cleaner!) - Prediction Error: Positive! This approach worked well - Learning: Brain strengthens “subtract to isolate” pathway\nAfter many cycles: The “subtract to isolate” rule becomes automatic\n\n\n\n\nWhy AI Eliminates the Learning Signal\nAI provides perfect answers instantly: - No prediction phase (student doesn’t generate expectations) - No attempt phase (student doesn’t try solutions) - No error phase (no comparison between expected and actual) - Result: Zero prediction errors = zero learning signal\nThe brain literally has nothing to learn from because the prediction-error cycle never occurs.\nThis explains why students can watch hundreds of worked examples or get thousands of correct AI answers and still not learn. Learning requires errors, not perfection.\n\n\n\nThe Desirable Difficulties Principle\nLearning requires what researchers call “desirable difficulties” (Bjork and Bjork 2011)—challenges that feel hard but promote long-term retention:\n\nRetrieval Practice: Pulling information from memory strengthens it\nSpaced Repetition: Forgetting and relearning creates durable knowledge\nInterleaving: Mixing problem types improves discrimination\nGeneration: Creating answers (even wrong ones) beats passive consumption\n\n\n\nThe Compilation Process\nReal expertise emerges through thousands of practice cycles:\nEncounter problem → Make prediction → Attempt solution → Compare to prediction → Get feedback → Neural adjustment\n                                                    ↓\n                                            Neural pathway strengthens\n                                                    ↓\n                                            Pattern becomes automatic\nEach cycle: - Strengthens neural connections through prediction errors - Reduces processing time through repetition - Frees working memory for higher-level thinking - Enables creative problem-solving through strong foundations\nHow expertise actually works: When you encounter a problem, multiple production rules compete. The rule with highest “utility” (based on past success through prediction errors) fires. Each successful use strengthens that rule, making it more likely to win future competitions. This is why experts seem to “just know”—their strongest productions fire automatically.",

Restructure Assessment to Value Process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Thinking Portfolio” Approach\n\n\n\nInstead of grading only final answers, create portfolios that showcase the learning journey:\n\n25% - Initial attempts (even if wrong)\n25% - Error analysis and corrections\n25% - Progressive improvement\n25% - Final understanding demonstration\n\nThis makes AI shortcuts counterproductive—students need authentic struggles to document.\n\n\n\n\n2. Design AI-Resistant Tasks\nTransform generic assignments into personal, contextual challenges:\n\nTraditionalAI-ResistantWhy It Works\n\n\n“Write an essay about climate change”\n\n\n“Connect climate change to three specific observations from your neighborhood this week”\n\n\nPersonal observations can’t be generated by AI, requiring genuine engagement with the topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Implement Progressive Problem Sets\nCreate assignments where each problem builds on insights from previous attempts:\nProblem 1: Solve 2x + 3 = 7\nProblem 2: Explain why your method from Problem 1 would fail for 2(x+3) = 7\nProblem 3: Create a problem that looks similar but requires a different approach\nAI can’t help when each step requires reflection on YOUR previous work.\n\n\n4. The Struggle Window Policy\nStructure class time to normalize and require cognitive effort:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimed Resource Access\n\n\n\nMinutes 0-10: Just you and the problem\nMinutes 10-20: Peer discussion allowed\nMinutes 20-30: Textbook/notes available\nMinutes 30+: Teacher consultation\nNever during class: AI consultation\n\n\n\n\n5. Create a Culture of Productive Failure\n\n\n\n\nCelebrate Errors\n\nError Museum: Display “magnificent mistakes”\nStruggle Journals: Daily reflection on confusion\nRed Pen Revolution: Red marks = growth opportunities\n\n\n\n\nMake Struggle Visible\n\nTrack time in productive struggle\nShare teacher’s own mistakes\nReward error analysis quality\n\n\n\n\n\n6. The Learning Gym Model\nFrame learning as mental fitness training:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning = Exercise for Your Brain\n\n\n\nJust like physical fitness, cognitive fitness requires:\n\nWorkout Plans: Posted topic-specific practice sequences\nReps: Practice problems (no shortcuts to mental fitness!)\nSpotters: Peer helpers who support but don’t do the lifting\nForm Check: Teacher feedback on technique\nProgress Tracking: Visible improvement charts\n\nPost this analogy prominently: “You wouldn’t expect muscles from watching someone else exercise. Why expect learning from watching AI think?”\n\n\n\n\n7. The Cognitive Load Meter\nTeach students to monitor and communicate their cognitive state:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Self-Assessment Tool\n\n\n\nHave students regularly indicate their cognitive load:\n\n🟢 Green: “Too easy—I’m not learning”\n🟡 Yellow: “Just right—productive struggle”\n🔴 Red: “Overloaded—need scaffolding”\n\nKey insight: 🟡 is the target zone!

    "section": "Understanding Cognitive Load Theory",
    "text": "Understanding Cognitive Load Theory\n\nThe Evolutionary Foundation of Learning\nCognitive Load Theory (CLT) is specifically concerned with how humans acquire biologically secondary knowledge—the academic content that schools exist to teach. Understanding this distinction is crucial for grasping why AI disrupts learning so profoundly.\n\nBiologically Primary vs. Secondary Knowledge\nBiologically Primary Knowledge (we evolved to learn): - Recognizing faces and voices - Understanding basic social interactions - Learning spoken language - Basic spatial navigation - Recognizing danger and safety\nBiologically Secondary Knowledge (we didn’t evolve to learn): - Reading and writing - Mathematics and algebra - Programming and data analysis - Scientific reasoning - Historical analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Distinction Matters\n\n\n\n\nPrimary knowledge can be learned through natural discovery and play\nSecondary knowledge requires explicit instruction and guided practice\nSchools exist precisely because secondary knowledge doesn’t develop naturally\nAI disruption is particularly damaging for secondary knowledge acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cognitive Architecture of Learning\nCLT is based on how human cognition actually processes information, using an architecture that mirrors evolution by natural selection (Sweller 2023):\n\nTwo Pathways for Novel Information\nHumans can acquire new biologically secondary information through two routes:\n\nDiscovery During Problem Solving: Working through challenges independently\nLearning From Others: Receiving information through instruction\n\nCrucially: Both these acquisition skills are themselves biologically primary—we evolved to be excellent at discovering things and learning from others. This is why humans dominate the mammalian world.\n\n\nThe Processing Bottleneck\nOnce information is acquired through either pathway, it must be processed through:\nWorking Memory: - Severely limited capacity (Miller’s 7±2, more recently Cowan’s 4±1 chunks) - Severely limited duration (15-30 seconds without rehearsal) - The bottleneck where all conscious learning occurs\nLong-Term Memory: - No known limits of capacity or duration - Where expertise lives through domain-specific information storage - The goal of all instruction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement Interactivity in Action\n\n\n\nConsider solving: (x + 3)(x - 2) = 0\nFor a novice, each element must be held in working memory: - What x represents - The meaning of parentheses - Addition and subtraction operations - Implied multiplication - The significance of “equals zero” - How to find solutions\nTotal: 7+ interacting elements = Working memory overload\nFor an expert, this is one chunk retrieved from long-term memory: - “Factored form, so x = -3 or x = 2”\nTotal: 1 chunk = Minimal working memory load\nWith AI assistance: - Input → Answer\nTotal: 0 working memory processing = No learning, no long-term memory storage\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Expertise Actually Develops\nAs De Groot first demonstrated in 1965, expertise is domain-specific and results from enormous amounts of domain-specific information stored in long-term memory. This isn’t just “knowing more facts”—it’s having organized knowledge structures (schemas) that allow experts to:\n\nChunk multiple elements into single units\nRecognize patterns automatically\nAccess procedures without conscious effort\nFree up working memory for higher-level thinking\n\n\n\nThe AI Disruption of Cognitive Architecture\nAI short-circuits this entire system:\n\nBypasses working memory processing: No cognitive effort means no encoding\nPrevents long-term memory storage: Information that isn’t processed isn’t stored\nEliminates schema construction: Students get answers without building knowledge structures\nBlocks the novice→expert transition: No pathway from limited to unlimited knowledge\n\nThe fundamental problem: AI provides the benefits of expertise (instant access to organized knowledge) without requiring the process that creates expertise (working memory struggle → long-term memory storage).",

    "text": "Pedagogical Implications\n\nThe Expert-Novice Teaching Trap\nThe most dangerous mistake in education is assuming that novices should learn the way experts work. This leads to what Kirschner calls confusing “the epistemology of the expert with the pedagogy for the learner.”\nWhat Experts Do (Producing Knowledge): - Work forward from automated principles - Recognize deep patterns instantly - Apply strong, domain-specific methods - Create and discover new knowledge - Process multiple elements simultaneously\nWhat Novices Need (Learning Knowledge): - Work backward using means-end analysis - Build basic pattern recognition through practice - Start with weak, general methods - Reconstruct and understand existing knowledge - Process elements sequentially to avoid overload\n\n\nWhy Expert Methods Actively Harm Novices\nGiving novices expert-level tools isn’t just ineffective—it’s actively harmful to learning:\n\n1. Cognitive Load Mismatch\n\nExperts can handle multiple interacting elements because they’ve chunked them into patterns\nNovices become overwhelmed when given the same complexity\nResult: Cognitive overload prevents any learning from occurring\n\n\n\n2. Production Rule Interference\n\nExperts have strong, successful production rules that fire automatically\nNovices need to build these rules through repeated weak-method practice\nAI shortcuts prevent the repetition needed for rule strengthening\nResult: Weak rules never develop, leaving permanent dependency\n\n\n\n3. Schema Construction Bypass\n\nExperts have rich schemas (organized knowledge structures) built through experience\nNovices must construct these schemas element by element\nAI answers provide the outcome without the construction process\nResult: No schemas form, preventing transfer to new situations\n\n\n\n4. Metacognitive Damage\n\nExperts know when and why to apply different strategies\nNovices develop this awareness through monitoring their own thinking\nAI dependency eliminates the need for self-monitoring\nResult: Students become unable to evaluate their own understanding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dependency Cascade\n\n\n\nWhen novices use expert-level tools prematurely:\n\nInitial success creates false confidence\nWeak methods atrophy from disuse\nProblem-solving skills deteriorate without practice\nDependency deepens as internal capabilities weaken\nTransfer fails when AI isn’t available\nLearned helplessness develops when facing novel challenges\n\nThis isn’t just “not learning”—it’s unlearning existing capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning Learning for Cognitive Architecture\nPrinciple 1: Respect the Developmental Sequence - Weak methods must come first—they’re not a bug, they’re a feature - Proceduralization requires extensive practice with conscious processes - Compilation happens automatically after sufficient repetition\nPrinciple 2: Calibrate Cognitive Load - Novices need simplified, sequential presentation - Experts can handle complex, parallel processing - The same material must be presented differently based on expertise level\nPrinciple 3: Protect the Struggle Window - Minimum 20 minutes of independent work before any AI consultation - Document thinking process before seeking external help - Multiple attempts required before accessing solutions\nPrinciple 4: Scaffold, Don’t Substitute - Use AI to reduce irrelevant cognitive load, not eliminate all effort - Provide worked examples that show the process, not just answers - Gradually fade support as competence develops",

    "text": "The Weak-to-Strong Methods Progression\nAccording to John Anderson’s ACT-R theory (Anderson 1982, 2007), expertise develops through a predictable progression:\n\n1. Weak Methods (Novice Stage)\nWeak methods are domain-general problem-solving strategies that novices use when they lack specific knowledge:\n\nMeans-End Analysis: “What’s the difference between where I am and where I need to be?”\nWorking Backward: “Start from the goal and work toward current state”\nAnalogy: “This reminds me of…” (often based on surface features)\nTrial and Error: “Let me try different things until something works”\nHill Climbing: “Always move toward what seems better”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Novice solving \\(3x + 5 = 20\\)\n\n\n\nUsing weak methods:\n\nGoal is to find \\(x\\)\nCurrent state: \\(3x + 5 = 20\\)\nHow to reduce difference?\nMaybe subtract \\(5\\)?\nWhy? Um… to get \\(x\\) alone?\nOK, so \\(3x = 15\\)\nNow what reduces the difference?\nDivide by \\(3\\)?\n\\(x = 5\\)\n\nNote the conscious, step-by-step reasoning!\n\n\n\n\n2. Proceduralization (Intermediate Stage)\n\nRepeated patterns become procedures\nStill conscious but more fluid\nReduced cognitive load\nFaster with fewer errors\nExample: Using multiplication tables from memory\n\nDuring this stage, knowledge begins forming into production rules. These are IF-THEN condition-action pairs:\n\nIF I see “3 × 4” THEN answer “12”\nIF equation has form “ax + b = c” THEN subtract b from both sides\nIF code won’t compile THEN check for syntax errors first\n\n\n\n3. Compilation (Expert Stage)\n\nKnowledge becomes automatic through many practice episodes\nPattern recognition dominates\nMinimal cognitive load\nFast and accurate\nCannot explain steps anymore!\n\nProduction strength determines which rules fire: frequently successful rules become stronger and fire faster. This is why practice improves both speed AND accuracy—stronger productions outcompete weaker alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Expert solving \\(3x + 5 = 20\\)\n\n\n\nExpert sees equation and can instantly recognize → \\(x = 5\\)\nWhen asked to explain:\n\n“I just… know?”\n“You subtract 5 and divide by 3”\n“How did I know that? I’m not sure…”\n\nThe knowledge has compiled into automatic procedures."

    "text": "Why Cognitive Effort Matters\n\nThe Desirable Difficulties Principle\nLearning requires what researchers call “desirable difficulties” (Bjork and Bjork 2011)—challenges that feel hard but promote long-term retention:\n\nRetrieval Practice: Pulling information from memory strengthens it\nSpaced Repetition: Forgetting and relearning creates durable knowledge\nInterleaving: Mixing problem types improves discrimination\nGeneration: Creating answers (even wrong ones) beats passive consumption\n\n\n\nThe Compilation Process\nReal expertise emerges through numerous practice cycles:\nEncounter problem → Conscious solving → Feedback → Adjustment\n                           ↓\n                    Neural pathway strengthens\n                           ↓\n                    Pattern becomes automatic\nEach cycle:\n\nStrengthens neural connections\nReduces processing time\nFrees working memory for higher-level thinking\nEnables creative problem-solving\n\nHow expertise actually works: When you encounter a problem, multiple production rules compete. The rule with highest “utility” (based on past success) fires. Each successful use strengthens that rule, making it more likely to win future competitions. This is why experts seem to “just know”—their strongest productions fire automatically."
