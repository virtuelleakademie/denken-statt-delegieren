# Speaker Notes: How We Build Expertise (Short Version)

## Slide 1: What You Just Experienced

**Time: 2-3 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Reference the hands-on exercise participants just completed
- Acknowledge their immediate feelings about each mode
- Plant the seed of doubt about their intuitions

**Speaker Script:**
"You've just experienced three different ways of researching a topic. Take a moment to reflect on how each mode *felt*. Without AI probably felt slower, maybe frustrating. The single AI prompt likely gave you confidence - quick, comprehensive answers. The collaborative AI session might have felt the most engaging.

But here's the critical question I want you to hold: Which of these will you actually remember next week? Your immediate feeling of efficiency or engagement doesn't predict what sticks in your brain. The answer might surprise you."

**Transition:** "Let me explain why schools exist in the first place..."

## Slide 2: Why Schools Exist: The Knowledge Divide

**Time: 3-4 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Distinguish biologically primary vs secondary knowledge
- Explain why some things need explicit teaching
- Connect to AI's assumptions about learning

**Speaker Script:**
"We evolved to learn certain things naturally - speaking, recognizing faces, reading emotions. Watch any toddler - they pick up language without formal instruction. This is biologically primary knowledge. Natural discovery works beautifully here.

But reading? Mathematics? Programming? We didn't evolve these abilities. They're biologically secondary - cultural inventions that our brains aren't wired to discover naturally. This is why schools exist. You can't just 'pick up' algebra by being around it.

Here's the problem: AI treats all knowledge as if it's primary - as if you can absorb complex skills just by seeing the answer. But your brain needs structured practice and struggle to build these unnatural abilities."

**Transition:** "So how does expertise actually develop in the brain?"

## Slide 3: How Expertise Actually Develops

**Time: 3-4 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Explain declarative vs procedural memory
- Use concrete examples they can relate to
- Show the journey from conscious to automatic

**Speaker Script:**
"Your brain has two key memory systems. Declarative memory is your 'knowing that' - facts and rules you can consciously state. When you first learn that 'to solve for x, subtract from both sides,' you hold this rule in your conscious mind. It's slow, effortful.

Procedural memory is your 'knowing how' - automatic responses that fire without conscious thought. An expert sees '3x + 5 = 20' and instantly knows x = 5. They can't even explain their thinking - it just happens.

The journey from novice to expert is literally moving knowledge from declarative to procedural through thousands of practice cycles. Each attempt strengthens the neural pathways. The struggle isn't a bug - it's the feature that creates expertise."

**Transition:** "Let me show you exactly what these 'atomic thinking steps' look like..."

## Slide 4: Productions: Your Brain's Atomic Thinking Steps

**Time: 3-4 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Define productions as IF-THEN rules
- Explain production competition
- Show why practice matters

**Speaker Script:**
"Think of productions as your brain's IF-THEN rules - the atomic units of thinking. IF you see '3x + 5 = 20' THEN subtract 5 from both sides. IF you're debugging code THEN check syntax first. Each one is a tiny automated response.

Here's what's fascinating: multiple productions compete. When a novice sees that equation, weak productions like 'guess and check' compete with stronger ones like 'isolate x.' The strongest production wins and fires automatically.

Complex expertise isn't one big skill - it's thousands of these atomic steps compiled together through practice. AI gives you the final answer but doesn't build any of these productions. It's like watching someone play piano versus developing the finger movements yourself."

**Transition:** "This is why AI creates a specific problem for learning..."

## Slide 5: The AI Bypass Problem

**Time: 3-4 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Three specific ways AI disrupts learning
- Keep it concrete and relatable
- Build urgency without being preachy

**Speaker Script:**
"AI disrupts learning in three critical ways:

First, no prediction errors. Your brain learns by predicting outcomes and adjusting when wrong. 'I think this approach will work... oh, it didn't.' That gap is the learning signal. AI eliminates this by giving instant correct answers.

Second, no memory formation. Information that isn't actively processed doesn't get stored. It's why you can read something and immediately forget it. When AI does the processing, your brain doesn't encode anything.

Third, no procedural development. Those thousands of atomic thinking steps we talked about? They only form through repetitive practice. AI skips straight to the answer, leaving your procedural memory empty.

The result? Surface fluency without deep understanding. You can talk about the topic but can't actually do it independently."

**Transition:** "And the research confirms this is exactly what's happening..."

## Slide 6: The Research Reality

**Time: 2-3 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Share specific statistics
- Make it relevant to their context
- Avoid sounding alarmist while being honest

**Speaker Script:**
"Recent studies are eye-opening. Students using AI heavily show a 68% reduction in critical thinking. Programming students using ChatGPT demonstrate only surface learning - they can modify AI's code but can't write original solutions.

We're even seeing the Flynn Effect reverse - IQ scores declining for the first time in decades, coinciding with when we stopped requiring memorization. Students literally cannot solve problems they've 'successfully' completed with AI just days before.

The irony? We're abandoning proven learning methods - spaced practice, retrieval, productive struggle - just as neuroscience is proving exactly why they work. We know more about learning than ever before, yet we're doing it worse than ever."

**Transition:** "So what should we actually do?"

## Slide 7: Practical Guidelines

**Time: 3-4 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Give specific, actionable advice
- Address the 20-minute rule clearly
- Provide the self-test

**Speaker Script:**
"Here's my strategic framework: Before any AI consultation, spend minimum 20 minutes in independent struggle. Not the 5 minutes from our exercise - that showed you the feeling. Real learning needs 20+ minutes for your brain to engage deeply.

Document your thinking. What have you tried? Where specifically are you stuck? Then use AI strategically to overcome that specific obstacle, not to replace your thinking process.

Here's your test: Am I using AI to enhance my thinking or replace it? If after 5 AI-assisted attempts you still can't solve similar problems independently, you're building dependency, not expertise. It's a crutch, not a tool.

The goal isn't to avoid AI - it's to use it in ways that make you think harder, not less."

**Transition:** "You have a choice to make..."

## Slide 8: Your Choice

**Time: 2-3 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Present the choice clearly
- Make it personal and empowering
- End with inspiration, not fear

**Speaker Script:**
"You face a choice with every learning challenge. The shortcut path offers perfect answers without understanding, creating fragile knowledge that doesn't transfer. You'll have false confidence but complete dependency.

The learning path requires struggle and confusion, but builds robust knowledge that transfers to new situations. You develop true intellectual autonomy and accurate self-assessment.

The goal is students who say: 'I could use AI, but then I wouldn't learn anything. Let me try this myself first.' This is someone who values their own intellectual growth over immediate comfort.

Remember: Your confusion isn't a bug - it's the feature that builds expertise. Embrace it."

**Additional Notes:**
- Watch for questions about specific AI uses
- Be prepared with examples from your discipline
- Keep tone encouraging, not condemning
- Time permitting, share a personal struggle story
