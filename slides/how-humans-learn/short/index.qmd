## What You Just Experienced {.transition}

Your Three Research Modes:

| Research Mode | Description | How did it feel? |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **Without AI** | *Classical sources* | Slower, effortful, uncertain |
| **Single AI Prompt** | *One question* | Fast, confident, comprehensive |
| **Collaborative AI** | *Iterative questions* |Engaging, interactive, refined |

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
### The Critical Question:
**Which mode will you remember and transfer a week from now?**

*The immediate "feel" doesn't predict long-term learning...*

## Why Schools Exist: The Knowledge Divide

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### 🧬 Biologically Primary
**We evolved to learn:**

- Speaking & understanding
- Recognizing faces  
- Reading social cues
- Basic problem solving

*Natural discovery works!*
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
### 🎓 Biologically Secondary  
**We didn't evolve to learn:**

- Reading & writing
- Mathematics & algebra
- Programming & analysis
- Scientific reasoning

*Needs explicit teaching & struggle!*
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
**AI assumes all knowledge is primary—but academic skills need structured practice.**

::: {.notes}
To understand why AI disrupts learning so profoundly, we need to understand why schools exist in the first place.

## How Expertise Actually Develops

### The Brain's Learning System:

| Memory Type | Description | Characteristics | Example |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **🧠 Declarative Memory** | **"Knowing That"** | • Facts and rules you hold consciously<br>• Slow, effortful retrieval | "To solve 3x + 5 = 20, subtract 5 from both sides" |
| **⚡ Procedural Memory** | **"Knowing How"** | • Automatic "atomic thinking steps"<br>• Fast, effortless execution | See 3x + 5 = 20 → instantly know x = 5 |

. . .

**The journey**: Facts → Thousands of practice cycles → Automatic procedures → Expertise

**Why struggle matters**: Each practice attempt strengthens the neural pathways that create expertise

## Productions: Your Brain's Atomic Thinking Steps

### How Complex Skills Are Built:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
**Productions = IF-THEN Rules**

- IF see "3x + 5 = 20" THEN subtract 5 from both sides
- IF stuck on code THEN check syntax first
- IF need to remember phone number THEN repeat internally

*Each one is an "atomic thinking step"*
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
**Production Competition**

When you see **3x + 5 = 20**:
- Production A: "Guess and check" (weak)
- Production B: "Subtract 5" (strong)
- **Winner**: Strongest fires automatically

*Practice strengthens winning productions*

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
**Why this matters**: Complex expertise = thousands of these atomic steps compiled together. **AI provides final answers without building the atomic steps.**

## The AI Bypass Problem

### Three Ways Learning Is Disrupted:

::: {.incremental}
1. **No Prediction Errors**: Brain learns from gaps between "what I expect" and "what happens"—AI eliminates this entirely

2. **No Memory Formation**: Information that isn't actively processed isn't stored—AI provides answers without processing

3. **No Procedural Development**: Expertise requires thousands of "atomic thinking steps"—AI skips this building process
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
**Result**: Surface fluency without deep understanding, complete dependency on tools
:::

---

## The Research Reality

### What Studies Show About AI Use in Learning:

::: {.incremental}
- **68% reduction in critical thinking** among high AI users
- **Surface learning only** in programming students using ChatGPT  
- **Flynn Effect reversal**: IQ scores declining since we stopped memorizing
- Students can't solve basic problems without AI after repeated AI-assisted attempts
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
**We abandoned proven learning methods just as neuroscience proved why they work!**
:::

---

## Practical Guidelines

::: {.callout-tip}
## The Strategic AI Use Framework

**Before Any AI Consultation:**

1. **Minimum 20 minutes** of independent struggle (not 5 from exercise!)
2. **Document your thinking**: What you tried and why you're stuck
3. **Use AI strategically**: To overcome specific obstacles, not replace thinking

**The Test**: Are you using AI to *enhance* your thinking or *replace* it?

**Red Flag**: If you can't solve similar problems without AI after 5 attempts, you're building dependency, not expertise

## Your Choice

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### ❌ The Shortcut Path:
- Perfect answers without understanding
- Fragile knowledge that doesn't transfer
- Complete dependency on tools
- False confidence in abilities
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
### ✅ The Learning Path:
- Deep understanding through struggle
- Robust knowledge that transfers
- True intellectual autonomy
- Accurate self-assessment

:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
## The Goal:
Students who say: *"I could use AI, but then I wouldn't learn anything. Let me try this myself first."*

**Your confusion isn't a bug—it's the feature that builds expertise!**
