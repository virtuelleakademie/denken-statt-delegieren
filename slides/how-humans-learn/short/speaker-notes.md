# Speaker Notes: How We Build Expertise (Short Version)

**Total Time: 12-15 minutes**

## Slide 1: What You Just Experienced

**Time: 2 minutes**

### Opening Hook

"Let's start by connecting what you just experienced to the science of learning. You've just done something that most people rarely do—you've consciously used three different research modes and can compare how they felt."

### Key Points to Make

- **Acknowledge their experience**: "I'm guessing Mode 1 felt slower and more uncertain. Mode 2 probably felt fast and comprehensive. Mode 3 likely felt engaging and interactive."
- **The critical insight**: "But here's the key question that most people never ask: Which mode will you remember and be able to use a week from now?"
- **Set up the tension**: "What feels good immediately often doesn't build lasting capability."

### Speaker Script

"You've just experienced three different ways of researching a topic. Take a moment to reflect on how each mode *felt*. Without AI probably felt slower, maybe frustrating. The single AI prompt likely gave you confidence - quick, comprehensive answers. The collaborative AI session might have felt the most engaging.

But here's the critical question I want you to hold: Which of these will you actually remember next week? Your immediate feeling of efficiency or engagement doesn't predict what sticks in your brain. The answer might surprise you."

### Transition

"This isn't just about convenience or efficiency—it's about how your brain actually builds expertise. Let's dive into the science..."

### Timing Note

Don't rush this slide. Let participants mentally connect their recent experience to what's coming.

## Slide 2: Why Schools Exist: The Knowledge Divide

**Time: 1.5 minutes**

### Core Message

"To understand why AI disrupts learning so profoundly, we need to understand why schools exist in the first place."

### Key Points

- **Primary knowledge examples**: "We evolved to recognize faces—babies do this automatically. We evolved to understand social cues, learn spoken language, navigate physical spaces."
- **Secondary knowledge examples**: "But we absolutely did not evolve to read squiggles on a page and turn them into meaning. We didn't evolve to manipulate abstract symbols like x + 5 = 20. These are recent human inventions."
- **The critical distinction**: "Natural discovery learning works great for primary knowledge—kids learn to talk without formal instruction. But it fails catastrophically for secondary knowledge—kids don't spontaneously learn to read or do algebra."

### Speaker Script Enhancement

"We evolved to learn certain things naturally - speaking, recognizing faces, reading emotions. Watch any toddler - they pick up language without formal instruction. This is biologically primary knowledge. Natural discovery works beautifully here.

But reading? Mathematics? Programming? We didn't evolve these abilities. They're biologically secondary - cultural inventions that our brains aren't wired to discover naturally. This is why schools exist. You can't just 'pick up' algebra by being around it."

### Emphasis

"AI assumes all knowledge is primary—that you can just discover or intuit the answer. But academic skills require explicit instruction and structured practice."

### Transition

"So how does this structured practice actually build expertise? Let's look at what happens in your brain..."

## Slide 3: How Expertise Actually Develops

**Time: 1.5 minutes**

### Core Message

"Your brain has two completely different memory systems, and understanding how they work together explains why shortcuts don't work."

### Declarative Memory Explanation

- **What it is**: "This is everything you consciously know—facts, rules, experiences. When you're learning algebra and thinking 'OK, to solve 3x + 5 = 20, I need to subtract 5 from both sides,' that's declarative memory."
- **Characteristics**: "It's slow, effortful, and you have to consciously retrieve information."

### Procedural Memory Explanation

- **What it is**: "This is everything you can do automatically. When an expert sees 3x + 5 = 20 and immediately knows x = 5 without thinking through steps, that's procedural memory."
- **Characteristics**: "It's fast, effortless, and you often can't explain how you did it."

### The Journey

"Expertise is the journey from conscious, effortful declarative knowledge to automatic, effortless procedural knowledge. This requires thousands of practice cycles where your brain physically rewires itself. The struggle isn't a bug - it's the feature that creates expertise."

### AI Connection

"Here's the problem: AI provides the endpoint—the automatic answer—without the journey that creates the brain changes."

### Transition

"But how exactly does this journey work? That's where ACT-R theory comes in..."

## Slide 4: Productions: Your Brain's Atomic Thinking Steps

**Time: 2 minutes**

### Core Message

"Complex expertise isn't magic—it's thousands of tiny IF-THEN rules called productions that your brain learns and strengthens through practice."

### Production Examples

- **Concrete examples**: "IF I see '3x + 5 = 20' THEN subtract 5 from both sides. IF my code won't compile THEN check syntax first. IF I need to remember a phone number THEN repeat it internally."
- **Atomic nature**: "These are like the atoms of thinking—simple building blocks that combine into complex skills."

### Production Competition

- **The mechanism**: "When you encounter a problem, multiple productions compete. The one with the highest strength wins."
- **Why practice matters**: "Each time you successfully use a production, it gets stronger and more likely to win next time."
- **Visual example**: "When you see 3x + 5 = 20, a novice might have weak productions like 'guess and check' competing with slightly stronger ones like 'subtract 5.' Through practice, the 'subtract 5' production becomes so strong it fires automatically."

### The Big Picture

"Complex expertise is thousands of these atomic thinking steps compiled together. Chess masters have about 50,000 chess-specific productions. Expert programmers have thousands of programming-specific productions."

### Critical AI Connection

"Here's why AI is so problematic: it provides the final answer without building any of these atomic thinking steps. It's like trying to build a house by starting with the roof."

### Transition

"So what exactly happens when AI bypasses this system?"

## Slide 5: The AI Bypass Problem

**Time: 1.5 minutes**

### Core Message

"AI doesn't just make learning less efficient—it actively prevents the brain mechanisms that create expertise."

### Three Disruptions (Present as Building Argument)

#### 1. No Prediction Errors

- **How learning works**: "Your brain learns by making predictions—'If I try this approach, it should work'—and then updating based on errors."
- **AI's impact**: "AI eliminates prediction errors entirely. No predictions, no attempts, no errors, no learning."

#### 2. No Memory Formation

- **The principle**: "Information that isn't actively processed isn't stored. Your brain literally doesn't encode what it doesn't work with."
- **AI's impact**: "When AI provides answers, your working memory never processes the information, so nothing gets stored in long-term memory."

#### 3. No Procedural Development

- **The requirement**: "Building those atomic thinking steps requires thousands of repetitions."
- **AI's impact**: "AI skips straight to the final answer, so no productions get built or strengthened."

### The Result

"Surface fluency without deep understanding. Students look competent but have built no actual capability."

### Transition

"You might think this is just theoretical concern, but the research shows it's happening right now..."

## Slide 6: The Research Reality

**Time: 1.5 minutes**

### Core Message

"This isn't speculative—we have data showing AI is already damaging learning."

### Present Evidence Powerfully

- **68% reduction**: "Knowledge workers who use AI confidently show 68% worse performance on critical thinking tasks."
- **Surface learning**: "Programming students using ChatGPT learn only surface patterns—they can't solve novel problems."
- **Flynn Effect reversal**: "IQ scores have been declining since the 1970s—exactly when we started using external tools to replace mental effort."
- **Dependency patterns**: "Students who use AI for math homework can't solve basic problems without it after just a few sessions."

### Historical Context

"We've been here before. When we moved away from memorization in schools—'Why memorize when you can look it up?'—we thought we were being progressive. But neuroscience now proves that memorization builds the very cognitive structures that enable higher-order thinking."

### The Pattern

"We keep abandoning proven learning methods just as science proves why they work."

### Transition

"So what do we do? Here are practical guidelines that work..."

## Slide 7: Practical Guidelines

**Time: 2 minutes**

### Core Message

"The solution isn't to ban AI—it's to use it strategically to enhance thinking, not replace it."

### The 20-Minute Rule

- **Why 20 minutes**: "Your exercise used 5-minute sessions—enough to feel different approaches but not enough to show the brain changes that build expertise. Real learning requires sustained effort."
- **What it accomplishes**: "Twenty minutes of struggle activates the prediction error system, engages working memory, and begins building those atomic thinking steps."

### The Strategic Framework

1. **Document thinking**: "Write down what you tried and why you're stuck. This forces active processing."
2. **Specific obstacles**: "Don't ask 'How do I solve this?' Ask 'I tried X and got stuck at Y—why didn't X work?'"
3. **Enhance, don't replace**: "Use AI to overcome specific barriers, not to do the thinking for you."

### The Test

"Ask yourself: Am I using AI to enhance my thinking or replace it? If you can't explain your reasoning without AI, you haven't learned—you've outsourced."

### Red Flag Warning

"If you can't solve similar problems without AI after 5 attempts, you're not building expertise—you're building dependency. Step back to worked examples and rebuild."

### Transition

"This brings us to a fundamental choice we all face..."

## Slide 8: Your Choice

**Time: 2 minutes**

### Core Message

"Every time you encounter a learning challenge, you're making a choice between two very different paths."

### The Shortcut Path

- **Immediate appeal**: "Perfect answers, no confusion, quick results."
- **Hidden cost**: "Fragile knowledge that collapses without tools, complete dependency, false confidence."
- **Long-term consequence**: "Learned helplessness when facing novel challenges."

### The Learning Path

- **Immediate reality**: "Confusion, struggle, uncertainty, slower progress."
- **Hidden benefit**: "Deep understanding, robust knowledge that transfers, true autonomy."
- **Long-term consequence**: "Genuine capability and confidence."

### The Ultimate Goal

"We want to create learners who say: 'I could use AI, but then I wouldn't learn anything. Let me try this myself first.'"

### Final Insight

"Your confusion isn't a bug in the learning process—it's the essential feature. It's the signal that your brain is doing the work that builds expertise."

### Closing Call to Action

"The choice is yours: optimization for immediate comfort or development of lasting capability. Choose wisely."

## Q&A Preparation (3-5 minutes)

### Common Questions and Responses

**"But AI helps me think through problems iteratively—isn't that good?"**
"It can be, if you're driving the process. The test is: Remove the AI. Can you recreate the reasoning independently? If not, you were a passenger, not the driver."

**"What about using AI for research and finding information?"**
"Using AI to find sources or summarize background information is different from using it to generate ideas or solve problems. The key is whether you're using it to reduce irrelevant cognitive load or essential cognitive work."

**"Isn't this just like calculators or spell-check?"**
"Great question. Calculators handle arithmetic—a small component of mathematical thinking. AI handles the reasoning itself. It's the difference between using a hammer and having someone else build the house."

**"How do we implement this in classrooms with pressure for quick results?"**
"Start with 'AI-free zones' for foundational skills. Assess process, not just products. Celebrate productive confusion. Most importantly, help students understand why struggle builds capability."

**"What about students who are really struggling—shouldn't they get help?"**
"Absolutely. But there's a difference between scaffolding and bypassing. Provide worked examples, break problems into steps, offer hints—but maintain the cognitive work that builds understanding."

### Additional Notes

- Watch for questions about specific AI uses
- Be prepared with examples from your discipline
- Keep tone encouraging, not condemning
- Time permitting, share a personal struggle story
