## The Question That Started It All {.transition}

After your exercise:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Without AI**: Deep thinking, struggle  
**Single prompt**: Quick answer, low effort  
**Iterative AI**: Some engagement
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Which mode built lasting understanding?

*The answer reveals why shortcuts can harm learning...*

## Why Schools Exist: The Knowledge Divide

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### üß¨ Biologically Primary
**We evolved to learn:**

- Speaking & understanding
- Recognizing faces  
- Reading social cues
- Basic problem solving

*Natural discovery works!*
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
### üéì Biologically Secondary  
**We didn't evolve to learn:**

- Reading & writing
- Mathematics & algebra
- Programming & analysis
- Scientific reasoning

*Needs explicit teaching!*
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
**AI assumes all knowledge is primary‚Äîbut academic skills need structured struggle.**

## The Learning Journey: Novice ‚Üí Expert

```{mermaid}

    A[üò∞ Novice<br/>Struggle & Errors] --> B[ü§î Intermediate<br/>Patterns Emerge]

    style B fill:#ffe66d,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px
    style C fill:#4ecdc4,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px
```

::: {.incremental}
- **Novice**: Step-by-step conscious reasoning (high effort)
- **Intermediate**: Chunking patterns, some automation (moderate effort)  
- **Expert**: Instant recognition, can't explain! (low effort)
:::

. . .

**Key insight**: The struggle *creates* the expertise‚Äîyou can't skip it!

## ACT-R Theory: How Minds Actually Work

### Two Memory Systems Working Together:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### üß† Declarative Memory
**"Knowing That"**

- Facts: "Paris is capital of France"
- Rules: "To isolate x, subtract from both sides"
- Examples: "Like problem #3 we did"

*Slow, conscious retrieval*
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
### ‚ö° Procedural Memory
**"Knowing How"**

- IF see equation THEN isolate x
- IF recognize pattern THEN apply rule
- Automatic, unconscious execution

*Fast, effortless performance*
:::

. . .

**The learning journey**: Declarative facts ‚Üí Practice ‚Üí Production rules ‚Üí Procedural expertise

## Knowledge Compilation in Action

**How declarative knowledge becomes automatic procedures:**

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[üìö Declarative<br/>"To solve 3x+5=20,<br/>subtract 5, then divide"] --> B[üîÑ Practice<br/>Apply rule<br/>many times]
    B --> C[‚ö° Production Rule<br/>"IF see 3x+5=20<br/>THEN answer x=5"]
    
    style A fill:#ffe66d,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ffb3ba,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#4ecdc4,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

::: {.incremental}
1. **Start**: Conscious rule-following (slow, effortful)
2. **Practice**: Repeated application strengthens neural pathways  
3. **Compilation**: Direct stimulus‚Üíresponse connections form
4. **Result**: Automatic expertise (fast, effortless)
:::

. . .

**AI skips steps 1-3 entirely!**

## The Working Memory Bottleneck

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
### üò∞ Novice Problem:
**(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0**

**7+ pieces to track:**
- What is x?
- Parentheses meaning?
- Operations involved?
- Why equals zero?
- How to solve?

**üß†üí• Overload!**
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
### üéØ Expert Problem:
**(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0**

**1 pattern recognized:**
- "Factored form ‚Üí x = -3 or x = 2"

**üß†‚úì Easy!**

::: {.column width="30%"}
### ü§ñ AI Problem:

## How the Brain Actually Learns

### The Prediction Error System:

::: {.incremental}
1. **Brain predicts**: "If I try this approach, it should work"
2. **Reality check**: "Did it work as expected?"
3. **Prediction error**: Gap between expected and actual
4. **Neural update**: Brain adjusts based on the error
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
## AI Eliminates Learning Signals
- **No predictions** (AI provides instant answers)
- **No attempts** (students don't try solutions)  
- **No errors** (AI is always "correct")
- **No learning** (brain has nothing to update)
:::

---

## The Expertise Illusion

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### ‚ùå What AI Creates:
- Perfect answers without understanding
- Surface fluency, fragile knowledge
- False confidence in abilities
- Complete dependency on tools
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
### ‚úÖ What Real Learning Creates:
- Deep understanding through struggle
- Robust knowledge that transfers
- Accurate self-assessment
- True intellectual autonomy
:::
:::

. . .

**The dangerous mistake**: Confusing AI's performance with your own learning.

---

## The Research Reality Check

Recent studies reveal alarming trends:

::: {.incremental}
- **68% reduction in critical thinking** among high AI users
- **Surface learning only** in programming students using ChatGPT  
- **Flynn Effect reversal**: IQ scores declining since we stopped memorizing
- Students can't solve basic problems without AI assistance
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
We abandoned proven learning methods just as neuroscience proved why they work!

## Practical Guidelines: The 20-Minute Rule

::: {.callout-tip}
## Before Any AI Consultation:

1. **Attempt independently** for minimum 20 minutes
2. **Document your thinking**: What you tried and why
3. **Identify where you're stuck** specifically
4. **Then use AI** to overcome specific obstacles, not replace thinking
:::

. . .

**Red flag test**: If you can't solve similar problems without AI after 5 attempts, you're building dependency, not expertise.

## Designing Learning Environments for Growth

### The Cultural Shift Required:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### ‚ùå Product-Focused Culture
- "Get the right answer quickly"
- Struggle = failure or incompetence  
- Errors are problems to hide
- Speed and efficiency valued
- AI use = being "smart"
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
### ‚úÖ Process-Focused Culture
- "Show me your thinking"
- Struggle = growth in progress
- Errors are learning opportunities
- Depth and understanding valued
- AI use = strategic choice
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
**Key insight**: Students avoid struggle when environments punish confusion and reward quick answers.
:::

---

## Creating Struggle-Positive Classrooms

### What This Looks Like in Practice:

::: {.incremental}
- **Celebrate productive confusion**: "That's a great question‚Äîyou're thinking deeply!"
- **Assess process, not just products**: Grade thinking steps, not just final answers
- **Share expert struggles**: Show how professionals work through problems messily
- **Time for thinking**: Built-in struggle time before any external help
- **Model uncertainty**: Teachers saying "I'm not sure, let me think..."
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
## The Environment Test
Students should feel **safe to be confused** and **proud of their thinking process**, not just their final answers.
:::

---

## What This Means for Teaching

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### ‚ùå Don't:
- Allow immediate AI consultation
- Accept AI-generated work as learning
- Skip the "struggling" phase  
- Treat all students as experts

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Protect struggle time
- Teach process, not just content
- Scaffold complexity appropriately
- Celebrate productive confusion
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Goal:
Students who say:

*"I could use AI, but then I wouldn't learn anything. Let me try this myself first."*

**This is the future**: Learners who choose growth over shortcuts.
:::

## Your Takeaway Challenge

::: {.callout-important}
## The Expertise Question

For your next learning challenge, ask yourself:

**"Am I using this tool to enhance my thinking or replace it?"**

Choose tools that make you **think harder**, not **think less**.
:::

. . .

**Remember**: Your confusion isn't a bug‚Äîit's the feature that builds expertise!
