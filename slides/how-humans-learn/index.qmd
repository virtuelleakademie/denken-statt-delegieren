## What You Just Experienced {.transition}

Your Three Research Modes:

| Research Mode | Description | How did it feel? |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **Without AI** | *Classical sources* | Slower, effortful, uncertain |
| **Single AI Prompt** | *One question* | Fast, confident, comprehensive |
| **Collaborative AI** | *Iterative questions* |Engaging, interactive, refined |



::: {.callout-important}
### The Critical Question:
**Which mode will you remember and transfer a week from now?**

*The immediate "feel" doesn't predict long-term learning...*

## Why Schools Exist: The Knowledge Divide

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Biologically Primary
**We evolved to learn:**

- Speaking & understanding
- Recognizing faces  
- Reading social cues
- Basic problem solving

*Natural discovery works!*
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
### Biologically Secondary  
**We didn't evolve to learn:**

- Reading & writing
- Mathematics & algebra
- Programming & analysis
- Scientific reasoning

*Needs explicit teaching & struggle!*
:::
:::



::: {.callout-important}
**Primary knowledge can be learned through natural discovery, while academic skills require explicit instruction and structured practice.**

::: {.notes}
To understand why AI disrupts learning so profoundly, we need to understand why schools exist in the first place.

## How Expertise Actually Develops {.smaller}

The Brain's Learning System:


| Memory Type                | Description        | Characteristics                                                       | Example                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Declarative Memory** | **"Knowing That"** | • Facts and rules you hold consciously<br>• Slow, effortful retrieval | "To solve <br> $3x + 5 = 20$, <br> subtract $5$ from both sides" |
| **Procedural Memory**   | **"Knowing How"**  | • Automatic "atomic thinking steps"<br>• Fast, effortless execution   | See <br>$3x + 5 = 20$ <br>→ instantly know $x = 5$               |


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
<br>

**The journey**: Facts → Thousands of practice cycles → Automatic procedures → Expertise

**Why struggle matters**: Each practice attempt strengthens the neural pathways that create expertise

## The Weak-to-Strong Methods Journey {.smaller}

How novices become experts through progressive skill building:

| Stage | Description | Methods/Characteristics | Nature |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Weak Methods (Novice)** | General strategies when lacking knowledge | • Means-end analysis<br>• Working backward<br>• Trial and error<br>• Surface analogies<br>• Hill climbing | *Slow, effortful, but essential for learning* |
| **Proceduralization** | Patterns become procedures | • Repeated sequences chunk together<br>• Still conscious but more fluid<br>• Reduced cognitive load<br>• Faster with fewer errors | *The critical transition phase* |
| **Strong Methods (Expert)** | Domain-specific automaticity | • Pattern recognition<br>• Forward chaining<br>• Compiled procedures<br>• Deep structural understanding | *Fast, accurate, unconscious* |

::: {.callout-warning}
## Why This Matters for AI Use
**AI provides expert-level answers (strong methods) to novices who haven't developed through weak methods first.** This skips the essential struggle phase where real learning occurs.

When novices use expert tools, they miss building the foundational procedures that enable true understanding.

## Productions: Your Brain's Atomic Thinking Steps {.smaller}

How Complex Skills Are Built:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
**Productions = `IF-THEN` Rules**

- IF see $3x + 5 = 20$ THEN subtract 5 from both sides
- IF stuck on code THEN check syntax first
- IF need to remember phone number THEN repeat internally

*Each one is an "atomic thinking step"*
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
**Production Competition**

When you see $3x + 5 = 20$:

- Production A: "Guess and check" (weak)
- Production B: "Subtract 5" (strong)
- **Winner**: Strongest fires automatically

*Practice strengthens winning productions*
:::
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.callout-note}
**Why this matters**: <br>
Complex expertise = thousands of these atomic steps compiled together. **Offloading provides final answers without building the atomic steps.**

## The AI Bypass Problem {.smaller}

Three Ways Learning Is Disrupted:

| Issue | Problem | Consequence of offloading to AI|
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **No Prediction Errors** | Brain learns from gaps between "what I expect" and "what happens" | Eliminates this entirely |
| **No Memory Formation** | Information that isn't actively processed isn't stored | Provides answers without processing |
| **No Procedural Development** | Expertise requires thousands of "atomic thinking steps" | Skips this building process |


<br> <br>

::: {.callout-warning}
**Result**: Offloading cognitive processes can lead to surface fluency without deep understanding and complete dependency on tools.

## The Research Reality

### What Studies Show About AI Use in Learning:

<!-- ::: {.incremental} -->
- **68% reduction in critical thinking** among high AI users
- **Surface learning only** in programming students using ChatGPT  
- **Flynn Effect reversal**: IQ scores declining since we stopped memorizing
- Students can't solve basic problems without AI after repeated AI-assisted attempts
<!-- ::: -->


::: {.callout-warning}
**We abandoned proven learning methods just as neuroscience proved why they work!**

## Evidence-Based Guidelines

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.callout-note}
1. **Embrace the Struggle**
   - Confusion is a necessary stage of learning
   - Errors provide valuable prediction error signals
   - Difficulty signals brain growth
:::
::: {.callout-note}
2. **Practice Retrieval**
   - Test yourself before checking answers
   - Explain concepts without notes
   - Teach others what you're learning
:::
::: {.callout-note}
3. **Space Your Learning**
   - Return to concepts over days/weeks
   - Allow forgetting between sessions
   - Relearn in different contexts
:::
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-note}
4. **Vary Your Practice**
   - Mix problem types
   - Change contexts
   - Seek novel applications
:::
::: {.callout-note}
5. **Protect Your Prediction Errors**
   - Make attempts before seeking help
   - Notice when your expectations are wrong
   - Use errors as learning opportunities, not failures

## Teaching That Matches How Brains Learn {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-important}
## 1. Respect the Developmental Sequence
- Weak methods must come first—they're not a bug, they're a feature
- Proceduralization requires extensive practice with deliberative processes
- Compilation happens automatically after sufficient repetition
:::
::: {.callout-important}
## 2. Calibrate Cognitive Load
- Novices need simplified, sequential presentation
- Experts can handle complex, parallel processing
- The same material must be presented differently based on expertise level
:::
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-important}
## 3. Protect the Struggle Window
- Allow sufficient time for independent struggle before AI consultation
- Document thinking process before seeking external help
- Multiple attempts required before accessing solutions
:::
::: {.callout-important}
## 4. Scaffold, Don't Substitute
- Use AI to reduce irrelevant cognitive load, not eliminate all effort
- Provide worked examples that show the process, not just answers
- Gradually fade support as competence develops
:::
:::
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## The Key Insight:
**AI is an expert-level tool**. Using it before building foundational skills through weak methods isn't just ineffective---it actively prevents the very processes that create expertise.

**Design learning experiences that match how brains actually develop competence.**
