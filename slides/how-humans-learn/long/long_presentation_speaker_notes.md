# Speaker Notes: How We Build Expertise (Full Version)

## Slide 1: What You Just Experienced

**Time: 3-4 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Reference the hands-on exercise participants just completed
- Acknowledge their immediate feelings about each mode
- Plant the seed of doubt about their intuitions

**Speaker Script:**
"You've just spent 15 minutes experiencing three different research modes. Let's be honest about how each one felt. Without AI - probably slower, more uncertain. You might have struggled to know where to start or felt frustrated by incomplete information.

The single AI prompt likely felt like magic - instant, comprehensive, confident answers. Everything you needed in seconds. The collaborative AI session probably felt most engaging - like having a knowledgeable colleague helping you refine your thinking.

But here's what I want you to consider: Which mode required YOUR brain to do the heavy lifting? And more importantly - which will you remember next week? Your immediate feeling of efficiency is not a good predictor of actual learning. Let's explore why."

**Transition:** "To understand this, we need to look at the difference between 15 minutes and 15 weeks..."

---

## Slide 2: From 15 Minutes to 15 Weeks

**Time: 3-4 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Contrast short-term experience with long-term learning
- Explain why our intuitions mislead us
- Set up the collaborative AI nuance

**Speaker Script:**
"Your 15-minute exercise gave you different immediate experiences. But real learning happens over 15 weeks of repeated practice. This isn't just more time - it's a fundamentally different process that literally rewires your brain.

We optimize for immediate comfort - the path of least resistance. AI feels efficient, so we assume it's effective for learning. But what feels good now often prevents capability later. It's like the difference between watching someone exercise versus building your own muscles.

The collaborative AI mode felt engaging, interactive. But engagement isn't learning. The question is: Did it build lasting neural pathways, or just create an illusion of understanding? The research suggests the latter, but with important nuances we need to explore."

**Transition:** "Because collaborative AI isn't all bad - it depends on how you use it..."

---

## Slide 3: When Collaborative AI Helps vs. Hurts

**Time: 4-5 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Provide nuanced view of AI collaboration
- Give specific examples of good vs bad use
- Introduce the key test question

**Speaker Script:**
"Let's be nuanced here. Collaborative AI can help when you maintain cognitive control. Using it to clarify your thinking: 'I believe X because Y - does my logic hold?' Overcoming specific obstacles: 'I understand the concept but this syntax is confusing.' Checking understanding: 'I think this means X - am I interpreting correctly?' Or reducing irrelevant cognitive load - grammar, formatting, citations.

But it hurts when AI drives the cognitive process. Generating core ideas: 'What should I think about this topic?' Doing the reasoning: 'How should I approach this problem?' Making connections: 'How does this relate to what I know?' Or most dangerously - replacing struggle: 'This is hard, help me skip the difficult part.'

The test is simple but critical: Are you using AI to enhance your thinking or replace it? If you can't do the task without AI after using it, you've replaced your thinking, not enhanced it."

**Transition:** "To understand why this matters, we need to look at why schools exist in the first place..."

---

## Slide 4: Why Schools Exist: The Knowledge Divide

**Time: 4-5 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Explain biologically primary vs secondary knowledge
- Use relatable examples
- Connect to AI's fundamental assumption error

**Speaker Script:**
"Humans evolved amazing learning abilities for certain things. Watch a toddler acquire language - no formal instruction needed. They recognize faces, read emotions, navigate social situations naturally. This is biologically primary knowledge - our brains are wired for it. Natural discovery and exploration work beautifully here.

But reading? That's only 5,000 years old - no evolutionary pressure. Mathematics, programming, scientific reasoning - these are biologically secondary. Cultural inventions our brains aren't wired to discover naturally. You can surround a child with books forever - they won't spontaneously learn to read.

This is why schools exist - to explicitly teach what we can't naturally acquire. And here's AI's fundamental error: it treats all knowledge as primary, as if exposure equals learning. But academic skills need structured struggle to rewire our brains in unnatural ways. AI provides the exposure without the required neural work."

**Transition:** "Let me show you the actual journey from novice to expert..."

---

## Slide 5: The Learning Journey: Novice â†’ Expert

**Time: 3-4 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Walk through the three stages with the diagram
- Emphasize the necessity of struggle
- Make it personal with examples

**Speaker Script:**
"Look at this journey every expert travels. Novices face high effort, conscious step-by-step reasoning, frequent errors. It's uncomfortable. An intermediate learner starts seeing patterns, chunks information, experiences some automation. Still effortful but smoother.

The expert? Instant recognition, automatic responses, can't even explain their process. Ask a chess master why they made a move - they 'just know.' Ask a programmer why they structured code that way - 'it feels right.'

Here's the key: You cannot skip the struggle phase. The errors, the effort, the conscious reasoning - that's not inefficiency to optimize away. That's your brain building the neural architecture of expertise. Every moment of struggle strengthens synaptic connections. AI offers the expert's answer without the journey that creates the expert's brain."

**Transition:** "To understand this deeply, let's look at ACT-R theory..."

---

## Slide 6: ACT-R Theory: How Minds Actually Work

**Time: 5-6 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Explain the two memory systems clearly
- Use concrete examples
- Show how they work together

**Speaker Script:**
"ACT-R theory gives us a scientific model of how minds actually work. You have two distinct memory systems operating in parallel.

Declarative memory is your 'knowing that' - facts, concepts, rules stored as chunks. Think of it as a network where each chunk connects to others. 'Paris is the capital of France' links to chunks about cities, countries, Europe. Retrieving information means searching through this network - it's conscious, effortful, slow.

Procedural memory is your 'knowing how' - stored as productions, IF-THEN rules that fire automatically. No conscious search needed. You see '2+2' and '4' fires instantly. You see red light, foot moves to brake. These are modular - each production learned independently - and they compete, with the strongest winning.

The learning journey transforms declarative chunks into procedural productions through practice. You start holding 'subtract from both sides' consciously in working memory. Through repetition, it compiles into an automatic production. This is how expertise develops - thousands of these atomic thinking steps compiled through experience."

**Transition:** "Let's look more closely at these productions..."

---

## Slide 7: Productions: Your Brain's IF-THEN Rules

**Time: 4-5 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Define productions clearly with examples
- Explain production competition
- Show why complex skills need many productions

**Speaker Script:**
"Productions are your brain's atomic thinking steps - the smallest units of skilled behavior. Each is an IF-THEN rule: IF I see this situation AND my goal is X, THEN do Y.

Watch what happens when you see '3x + 5 = 20'. Multiple productions compete. The novice has weak productions: 'guess and check values.' The practiced student has stronger ones: 'subtract 5 from both sides.' The strongest production wins and fires. This competition happens in milliseconds, below consciousness.

Here's what people miss: Complex expertise isn't one big skill - it's thousands of these productions working together. A programmer debugging code has productions for recognizing syntax errors, logic errors, off-by-one errors, null pointer issues. Each was learned separately through experience.

AI provides the output of all these productions without building any of them. It's like showing you a symphony without teaching you to play any notes. You can appreciate the music but can't create it yourself."

**Transition:** "This explains why transfer between domains is so limited..."

---

## Slide 8: Why Transfer Is So Limited

**Time: 4-5 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Explain Scott Young's insight about shared productions
- Address why school feels "useless"
- Reframe partial learning as valuable

**Speaker Script:**
"Here's a profound insight from Scott Young: Transfer only occurs when skills share productions. Chess strategy doesn't transfer to business because they use completely different IF-THEN rules. The productions for 'attacking the king' don't help with 'market analysis.'

Research confirms transfer is linear in the number of shared productions. Algebra to geometry? Some shared productions about equations, but different ones for spatial reasoning. Python to JavaScript? Shared algorithmic thinking productions, different syntax productions.

This explains why school often feels 'useless.' You learn 50% of the productions needed for real-world problems - can't solve them yet. But here's what critics miss: learning that 50% makes acquiring the other 50% twice as fast. School creates learning potential, not immediate performance. It builds the foundation productions that make future learning efficient."

**Transition:** "Let me show you exactly how these productions form..."

---

## Slide 9: Knowledge Compilation in Action

**Time: 4-5 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Walk through the compilation process step by step
- Use the diagram to reinforce visually
- Emphasize what AI skips

**Speaker Script:**
"Watch how atomic thinking steps become automatic. You start with declarative chunks - consciously knowing 'ax = b means divide both sides by a.' Holding this in working memory while solving problems is slow, effortful, error-prone.

Through practice, each successful application strengthens the production. The brain notices the pattern: every time I see 'ax = b' and apply this rule, I succeed. The production gains strength, competing more effectively against alternatives.

After enough repetitions, compilation occurs - a direct pattern-to-response connection forms. No more conscious rule retrieval. See 'ax = b', immediately know 'x = b/a.' The declarative knowledge hasn't disappeared - you can still explain the rule. But you don't need it anymore.

AI provides step 5 - the final automatic response - without steps 1 through 4. It's like teleporting to the destination without taking the journey. You arrive but haven't built the mental muscles to get there again yourself."

**Transition:** "You already know this from your own experience..."

---

## Slide 10: Why Some Things Are Easy, Others Hard

**Time: 4-5 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Use familiar examples everyone can relate to
- Show same information, different access routes
- Make the abstract concrete

**Speaker Script:**
"Let's make this concrete with examples from your daily life. Say the alphabet forward - easy, automatic, procedural memory. Now say it backward. Suddenly hard! You must use declarative memory - recite forward, hold in working memory, manually reverse, then speak. Same information, different neural access route.

Type your name - your fingers move automatically. Spell it aloud - requires conscious letter retrieval. Same information again, but typing uses procedural muscle memory while spelling uses declarative recall.

When you repeat a phone number, you're rehearsing to keep chunks active in declarative memory. Do it enough, it becomes procedural - you 'just know' your childhood phone number decades later.

This is why expertise feels magical. The expert accesses information through procedural memory - fast, automatic, effortless. The novice uses declarative memory - slow, conscious, hard. Same knowledge, fundamentally different neural implementation."

**Transition:** "This creates a critical bottleneck for novices..."

---

## Slide 11: The Working Memory Bottleneck

**Time: 4-5 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Show the dramatic difference in cognitive load
- Use the three-column comparison
- Emphasize why AI prevents chunking

**Speaker Script:**
"Working memory holds about 3-4 chunks - that's it. Look what happens with '(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0'.

The novice sees 7+ pieces: What's x? What do parentheses mean? How do multiply these? Why equals zero? How do I solve this? Their working memory overflows, creating that frustrated 'I can't hold it all in my head' feeling.

The expert sees one pattern: 'factored form.' Their procedural memory instantly knows x = -3 or 2. No working memory load at all. The pattern recognition happens automatically, leaving working memory free for higher-level thinking.

With AI? Zero processing. Copy equation, paste, get answer. No chunking occurs. The novice never develops the pattern recognition that reduces cognitive load. They remain perpetually overwhelmed by complexity because AI prevented the chunking process that makes complex problems manageable."

**Transition:** "But the deepest problem is how AI disrupts the brain's fundamental learning mechanism..."

---

## Slide 12: How the Brain Actually Learns

**Time: 5-6 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Explain prediction error learning clearly
- Show why this is fundamental to all learning
- Connect to AI's elimination of this process

**Speaker Script:**
"Your brain is fundamentally a prediction machine. Every action starts with a prediction: 'If I try this approach, it should work.' You attempt the solution. Reality provides feedback. The gap between prediction and reality - that's the prediction error.

This error is pure gold for your brain. Large error? Major neural adjustment needed. Small error? Minor tweaking. No error? No learning. The prediction error literally drives synaptic changes. It's how your brain updates its model of the world.

Watch a baby learning to walk. Predict: 'This movement will keep me balanced.' Try it. Fall over. Huge prediction error! Brain adjusts motor predictions. Try again. Smaller error. Eventually, predictions match reality - walking achieved.

AI eliminates this entirely. No predictions because answers appear instantly. No attempts because solutions are provided. No errors because AI is 'correct.' No learning because your brain has nothing to update. It's like trying to get fit by watching someone else exercise."

**Transition:** "This creates a dangerous illusion..."

---

## Slide 13: The Expertise Illusion

**Time: 4-5 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Contrast what AI creates vs real learning
- Make the distinction sharp and clear
- Warn about the seductive nature of the illusion

**Speaker Script:**
"AI creates a compelling illusion. You get perfect answers, feel productive, gain confidence. You can discuss topics fluently, modify AI's code, seem competent. But it's surface performance without deep capability.

Real learning creates something entirely different. Through struggle, you build robust understanding that transfers to novel situations. You develop accurate self-assessment - you know what you know and what you don't. Most importantly, you achieve intellectual autonomy - the ability to think and solve independently.

The illusion is seductive because it feels so good. No struggle, no confusion, no errors. But you're mistaking AI's performance for your own learning. It's like confusing watching a concert with being able to play the instrument. The output looks the same, but one is passive consumption, the other is active capability."

**Transition:** "And research is now confirming just how damaging this illusion is..."

---

## Slide 14: The Research Reality Check

**Time: 4-5 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Present research findings with appropriate gravity
- Connect to broader trends
- Emphasize the irony of our timing

**Speaker Script:**
"The research is sobering. Students using AI heavily show 68% reduction in critical thinking skills. They literally lose the ability to analyze and evaluate independently. Programming students demonstrate only surface learning - they can modify existing code but can't create original solutions or debug novel problems.

We're seeing the Flynn Effect reverse for the first time in a century. IQ scores rose for decades as education improved. Now they're declining, coinciding exactly with when we stopped requiring memorization and started allowing constant digital assistance.

Most tellingly - students can't solve problems they 'successfully' completed with AI just days before. The knowledge never transferred to their brains. They were passengers, not drivers.

The tragic irony? We're abandoning proven learning methods - spaced practice, retrieval, generation, interleaving - just as neuroscience is revealing exactly why they work. We know more about learning than ever, yet we're doing it worse than ever."

**Transition:** "So what path should we take?"

---

## Slide 15: The Two Paths Forward

**Time: 3-4 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Use the visual diagram effectively
- Make the choice stark but not preachy
- Emphasize agency and empowerment

**Speaker Script:**
"Every learning challenge presents this choice. The AI shortcut path is tempting - fast answers, no struggle, immediate satisfaction. But it leads to dependency and fragility. When the tool isn't available or the problem shifts slightly, you're helpless.

The learning path requires productive struggle. It's slower, more effortful, sometimes frustrating. But it builds expertise and transfer. You develop capabilities that work across contexts, that grow and compound over time.

This isn't about being anti-technology. It's about choosing tools that enhance rather than replace your thinking. The path you choose repeatedly shapes who you become - dependent consumer or independent thinker."

**Transition:** "So what does this mean practically?"

---

## Slide 16: Practical Guidelines: Beyond the Exercise

**Time: 5-6 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Connect back to their exercise experience
- Provide specific, actionable guidelines
- Address the 20-minute rule thoroughly

**Speaker Script:**
"Your 5-minute exercise segments showed different immediate experiences. But real learning requires 20+ minutes of sustained engagement. Why 20 minutes? That's roughly when your brain shifts from surface processing to deep engagement, when real neural work begins.

Before any AI consultation: Spend minimum 20 minutes in independent attempt. Not just thinking about it - actively trying solutions. Document your thinking - what approaches did you try? Why did you reject them? Where specifically are you stuck?

Then use AI strategically for specific obstacles. 'I understand the concept but this syntax confuses me.' Not 'How do I solve this?' but 'Why doesn't my approach work?'

Here's your test: After 5 AI-assisted attempts, can you solve similar problems independently? If not, you're building dependency. The AI should be scaffolding you can eventually remove, not a permanent crutch."

**Transition:** "But individual choice isn't enough - we need supportive environments..."

---

## Slide 17: Designing Learning Environments for Growth

**Time: 5-6 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Contrast the two cultures clearly
- Explain why environment shapes behavior
- Give hope for change

**Speaker Script:**
"Individual willpower isn't enough when the environment punishes struggle. In product-focused cultures, we value quick answers, hide errors, see confusion as failure. Students learn to use AI because it's the 'smart' thing to do - it gets the grade.

Process-focused cultures value thinking over answers. Struggle signals growth in progress. Errors become learning opportunities. We assess the journey, not just the destination. AI becomes one tool among many, chosen strategically.

Students avoid struggle when environments punish confusion and reward quick answers. They embrace it when we celebrate productive confusion and grade thinking processes. The same student behaves completely differently in these two environments.

We must create cultures where students feel safe to be confused and proud of their thinking process. Where 'I don't know yet' is better than an unearned answer."

**Transition:** "Here's what this looks like in practice..."

---

## Slide 18: Creating Struggle-Positive Classrooms

**Time: 5-6 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Provide concrete, implementable strategies
- Share what works from research
- Make it feel achievable

**Speaker Script:**
"Creating struggle-positive classrooms starts with language. 'That's a great question - you're thinking deeply!' instead of 'Let me show you the quick way.' Celebrate productive confusion as evidence of learning, not failure.

Assess process, not just products. Grade thinking steps, rough drafts, problem-solving approaches. Make the journey visible and valued. Share your own struggles - experts showing their messy process normalizes difficulty.

Build in struggle time before any external help. 'Try for 20 minutes before asking questions.' Not as punishment but as protected learning time. Model uncertainty yourself - 'I'm not sure, let me think through this...' shows that experts also struggle.

The environment test: Students should leave class feeling proud of their thinking effort, not just their final answers. They should see confusion as a signal they're learning something meaningful, not a problem to quickly solve."

**Transition:** "So what does this mean for teaching practice?"

---

## Slide 19: What This Means for Teaching

**Time: 4-5 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Provide clear dos and don'ts
- Focus on the ultimate goal
- Inspire rather than prescribe

**Speaker Script:**
"Stop allowing immediate AI consultation. That first struggle period is sacred learning time. Don't accept AI-generated work as evidence of learning - it's evidence of AI's capability, not the student's. Never skip the struggling phase even if it's uncomfortable to watch.

Instead, protect struggle time fiercely. Teach process skills explicitly - how to break down problems, how to persist through confusion. Scaffold complexity appropriately - not too easy, not impossible. Celebrate productive confusion as growth in action.

The goal is students who say: 'I could use AI, but then I wouldn't learn anything. Let me try this myself first.' This is intellectual maturity - choosing long-term growth over short-term comfort. This is the future we need: learners who value their own development enough to embrace difficulty."

**Transition:** "Let me leave you with a challenge..."

---

## Slide 20: Your Takeaway Challenge

**Time: 3-4 minutes**

**Key Points:**
- Make it personal and actionable
- End with empowerment, not fear
- Inspire commitment to growth

**Speaker Script:**
"For your next learning challenge, big or small, ask yourself one question: 'Am I using this tool to enhance my thinking or replace it?' Be honest. If the tool does the thinking for you, you're choosing the illusion over the reality.

Choose tools that make you think harder, not less. That force you to articulate your reasoning, not skip it. That overcome specific obstacles, not the entire journey.

Your confusion isn't a bug - it's the feature that builds expertise. Every moment of productive struggle literally rewires your brain for greater capability. Embrace it. Protect it. Value it.

The choice you make repeatedly - shortcut or learning path - shapes not just what you know, but who you become. Choose growth."

**Transition:** "I'd love to hear your thoughts and questions..."

---

## Slide 21: Questions & Discussion

**Time: Remaining time**

**Key Points:**
- Start with the prompt question if no immediate questions
- Be prepared for common challenges
- Keep focus on learning, not anti-AI rhetoric

**Speaker Script:**
"Let's discuss how we might redesign learning experiences to embrace productive struggle while leveraging AI appropriately. What challenges do you see? What opportunities?"

**Common Questions to Prepare For:**
1. "But AI is the future - shouldn't we prepare students?"
   - Yes, but prepare them to use it wisely, not depend on it
   
2. "What about students who struggle too much?"
   - Calibrated struggle, not overwhelming frustration
   
3. "How do we grade process fairly?"
   - Rubrics that value thinking steps, show examples
   
4. "Won't this slow down content coverage?"
   - Deep learning of less vs surface coverage of more

**Closing thought if time:**
"Remember - every expert was once a struggling novice who chose to persist. The struggle isn't the obstacle to expertise - it's the path."
